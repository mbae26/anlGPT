Curtiss*b\n\nThe energies of the 133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of\ntheory and then were used to calculate their enthalpies of formation. This database contains organic\nmolecules having nine or less atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and \ufb02uorine, as well as hydrogen\natoms. The accuracy of the G4MP2 energies was investigated on a subset of 459 of the molecules\nhaving experimental enthalpies of formation with small uncertainties. On this subset the G4MP2\nenthalpies of formation have an accuracy of 0.79 kcal mol\u00011, which is similar to its accuracy previously\nreported for the smaller G3/05 test set. An error analysis of the theoretical enthalpies of formation of the\n459 molecules is presented in terms of the size and type of the molecules. Three di\ufb00erent density\nfunctionals (B3LYP, uB97X-D, M06-2X) were also assessed on 459 molecules of accurate enthalpy data\nfor comparison with the G4MP2 results.

Thermochemical data\nprovide the information needed to determine stabilities and\nreactivities of molecules present in combustion, battery electrolytes, drugs, the atmosphere, catalysis, etc. It is especially\nimportant that the thermochemical data for molecules be of\nchemical accuracy (<1 kcal mol\u00011) for such applications.\nComposite quantum chemical methods have been developed\nthat can give molecular energies accurate to better than\n1 kcal mol\u00011. This includes methods such as the Gn theory,1\u20134\nthe Complete Basis Set (CBS) methods,5\u20137 the correlation\nconsistent Composite Approaches (ccCA),8\u201310 the multicoe\ufb03cient correlation methods (MCCMs),11\u201313 Weizmann (Wn)\nmethods,14\u201317 and the Wuhan-Minnesota scaling WMS\nmethod.18 In addition, accuracies of as small as 0.1 kcal mol\u00011\ncan be obtained for small molecules using much more expensive and elaborate methods.19\u201321 While density functional\nmethods are faster, even the latest methods have not yet\nreached an accuracy of better than 1 kcal mol\u00011.22,23 With the\npower of today's computers and using quantum chemical\na\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky\n40292, USA\n\nb\n\nMaterials Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois 60439,\nUSA.

In Section II we describe the database and\nmolecular notation used as well as the quantum chemical\nmethods.

More speci\ue103cally, in the G4MP2 method\nsecond-order perturbation theory is used in place of the time\nconsuming fourth-order perturbation theory components in the\nG4 method. As a result the G4MP2 method is approximately six\nto eight times faster than the G4 method.1 Other parts of the\nmethod remain the same as in G4 theory including the CCSD(T)\ncomponent, geometries, and zero-point energies.

For the 138 hydrocarbons and\nsubstituted hydrocarbons in the G3/05 test set the mean absolute deviation was 0.77 kcal mol\u00011. In order to better assess the\nlikely accuracy of G4MP2 for the GDB-9 database of 133 296\nmolecules we have selected 459 molecules from the Pedley\ncompilation26 that have very accurate (<1 kcal mol\u00011) gas phase\nenthalpies of formation. More details on this test set and how it\nwas selected is given in the next section. All calculations were\ncarried out with the Gaussian code.27\nIn addition, we have carried out density functional calculations on these 459 molecules with three density functional\nmethods. The B3LYP28 density functional results on these\nmolecules were included in this study because they are part of\nthe G4MP2 calculation with B3LYP being used for the geometry\noptimizations. Since the development of the hybrid GGA B3LYP\nfunctional, numerous other functionals with better performance have been reported.22,23 We chose two other popular\nfunctionals to assess on the 459 molecules, namely, M06-2X,29\na hybrid meta-GGA functional, and uB97X-D,30 a GGA functional with dispersion correction. The 6-31G(2df,p) basis set\nused for the B3LYP functional, while the 6-311+G(3df,2p) basis\n(at B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) geometries) is used for the M06-2X and\nuB97X-D functionals. A smaller basis set was used for B3LYP as\nit gives better results than the larger basis set. It has been noted\npreviously that improvement in the basis sets does not always\nlead to improvement in results as is the case with wave function\nbased methods.25 It has been suggested that this is due to\ncancelation of errors from an overestimation of the basis set\nsuperposition error that compensates for the lack of a dispersion correction.31\n\n7450 | Chem.

The molecules with 9 nonhydrogen atoms dominate the database, comprising \u000383% of\nthe molecules (i.e., 111 128) in the GDB-9 database as shown in\nTable 1; in comparison, there are only 3 molecules with one\nheavy atom, namely CH4, NH3, and H2O. This is expected, owing\nto the large number of elemental combinations, and isomers\npossible for molecules made-up of 9 heavy atoms. In terms of\nmolecule types, those made up exclusively of H, C, O and N\natoms (listed as HCON) are most prominent (\u000350%), followed\nby HCO (\u000334%).

In order to ensure that we\nhad a reasonably accurate experimental test set we examined\nmore closely all experimental values that di\ufb00ered by more than\n2.50 kcal mol\u00011 with G4MP2, of which there were 63. We then\nchecked to see if there were any other recent experimental\nvalues that con\ue104icted with the Pedley values. In 12 cases (see\nESI\u2020) there were other values that di\ufb00ered by more than\n1 kcal mol\u00011, the quoted uncertainty of the Pedley value. In\nthose cases we eliminated them from the test set as we could\nnot verify their accuracy. That le\ue09d 51 cases of di\ufb00erences greater\nthan 2.5 kcal mol\u00011. In those cases we used an isodesmic\nscheme34 to evaluate the questionable experimental values.

This plot shows a gradually\nincreasing error with size of the molecule for G4MP2. This is\nexpected and has been found previously for long chain\nalkanes.37 The increase in error with size is due to the increase\nin the number of electron pairs. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the\nerror per electron pair as a function of number of heavy atoms.\nThis shows that the size of the error is quite level with\nincreasing molecule size. In terms of calculating reaction\nenergies from G4MP2 enthalpies of formation (see Section IV),\nthe resulting reaction energies should be quite accurate because\nthey are based on breaking one or a couple of bonds, whereas\nthe enthalpies of formation are based on breaking all bonds in\nthe molecule, i.e. they are calculated from atomization energies\n(along with temperature corrections, elemental standard states,\nand zero-point energies).38\nThe Pedley test provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy of some popular density functional methods for thermochemical data of larger molecules. Previous test sets of\nthermochemical data used for assessing density functional have\nnot included as extensive a set of larger molecules as the Pedley\nset established for this work. An error analysis on the Pedley test\nset was carried out for three popular DFT methods B3LYP,28\nM06-2X,29 and uB97X-D.30 The results for these three functionals are given in Table 2 with details for all 459 molecules\ngiven in ESI Tables 3\u20135.\u2020 The uB97X-D functional performs the\nbest with a mean absolute deviation of 1.85 kcal mol\u00011 for the\n459 molecules. M06-2X has an mean absolute deviation of\n2.71 kcal mol\u00011. B3LYP has the largest mean absolute deviation\nof the three at 3.99 kcal mol\u00011. Thus, even the best functional\ntested has a mean absolute deviation of more than twice as large\nas G4MP2. Fig. 1 shows the MAD for the three functionals as\na function of the number of heavy atoms (CNOF) in the molecule. The plots show a generally increasing error with size of the\nmolecule for the three functionals. In Fig. 2 the error per electron pair is plotted as a function of number of heavy atoms,\nwhich shows that the error remains approximately constant as\nthe molecule size increases with the exception of B3LYP that\n\n7452 | Chem.

The breakdown of the mean\nabsolute deviations for B3LYP with G4MP2 as a function of size\nof the molecule and type of molecule is given in ESI Fig. 1.\u2020 The\nerror increases slightly with size of molecule. In addition, the\nB3LYP results in this \ue103gure indicate that the molecules containing \ue104uorine have much larger deviations with G4MP2 than\nthose not containing \ue104uorine.\nThe database of G4MP2 enthalpies of formation provides\na source of data for the derivation of accurate energies of\nmillions of reactions involving organic molecules up to nine\nheavy atoms. To illustrate this we have calculated some energies\nfor \ue103ve di\ufb00erent types of reactions from the G4MP2 energies\nand tabulate them in Table 3. These include (1) alcohol oxidation, (2) alkane oxidation, (3) ether hydrolysis, (4) hydrogenolysis, and (5) carbonyl reduction. Energies for all of these\ntypes of reactions are expected to be accurate to about\n1 kcal mol\u00011 based on the accuracy of the G4MP2 energies. In\naddition to the reaction energies that can be derived, the large\ndatabase of enthalpies of formation also provides a basis on\nwhich to assess existing or newly measured enthalpies of\nformation. The method by which the enthalpies of formation\ncan be obtained from the database of G4MP2 energies33 is\ndescribed in the ESI.\u2020\n\nV. Conclusions\nEnergies for the \u0003133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database,\ncontaining organic molecules having nine or less atoms of\ncarbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and \ue104uorine as well as hydrogen\natoms, have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of theory. The\nfollowing conclusions can be drawn from this study:\n(1) The accuracy of the G4MP2 energies was investigated on\na subset of 459 of the molecules having experimental enthalpies\nof formation with small uncertainties and was found to have an\naccuracy of 0.79 kcal mol\u00011, which indicates the G4MP2\nenthalpies of formation of the GDB-9 database should have\na similar accuracy.\n(2) Three di\ufb00erent density functionals (B3LYP, uB97X-D,\nM06-2X) were also assessed on 459 molecules of accurate\nenthalpy data for comparison with the G4MP2 results and the\nlatter two were found to be much more accurate that B3LYP, but\nless accurate than G4MP2.\n(3) The G4MP2 energies for the 133 K molecules provide\na database that can be used to calculate accurate reaction\nenergies as well as to assess new or existing experimental\nenthalpies of formation.\nThe G4MP2 energies of the GDB-9 molecules will also be\nuseful in future investigations of applications of machine\nlearning to quantum chemical data by providing a large database of accurate energies for machine learning to develop new\n\n7454 | Chem.

One of the critical\nchallenges of realizing a multivalent-ion battery is the strong polarization that results in the\nsluggish intercalation of ions in the host lattice, which motivates a fundamental understanding of\nmultivalent-ion dynamics in solid-state materials. In this contribution, we investigate the\ndiffusion mechanisms of divalent ions in a novel Mg anode coating, BiOCl, using first-principles\ninformed learning-on-the-fly molecular dynamics. Based on nanosecond-scale dynamics\nobservations, we gained insights into the concerted diffusion mechanism of Mg cation site-to-site hopping facilitated by\nsynchronous anion rotational motion. Furthermore, we compute the Mg-ion diffusion in additional candidate host structures\nscreened from available layered materials space.

On the\nanode side, in contrast to the ionically conductive solidelectrolyte interphase layer formed in Li-ion batteries, the\nformation of an ionically insulating surface layer in numerous\nconventional electrolytes results in irreversible plating/\nstripping of Mg.4\u22126 Another challenge is the sluggish insertion\nkinetics of the Mg in the cathode host structure due to its\ndivalent nature, which generates large overpotentials for Mg\nintercalation and greatly hinders the commercialization of Mgion batteries.7,8\nMany research efforts have been devoted to the material\ndesign of an artificial interphase layer on the anode that\nmitigates detrimental decomposition reactions and facilitates\ncharge transfer.

In\nterms of first-principles investigations, the climbing image\nnudged elastic band method (CI-NEB)23,24 and ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations are the two common\napproaches to calculating the ionic diffusion rate. The CI-NEB\nmethod is frequently used to determine the energy of the\ntransition state along the minimum energy path; however, this\napproach requires prior knowledge of the diffusion mechanism,\nwhich substantially affects the prediction accuracy of migration\nenergy. AIMD does not require prior knowledge of the\ndiffusion mechanism, but it comes with a high computational\ncost due to longer-scale dynamic simulations based on a firstprinciples approach. The challenges of using AIMD to study\nsolid-state conduction of multivalent ions arise from their high\ncharge density and strong Coulombic interactions with the\nanion sublattice, which results in sluggish diffusion through\nsolid materials.25\u221227 Owing to the high computational cost of\nAIMD simulation and the rare occurrence of multivalent ion\nhopping, we adopted learning on-the-fly molecular dynamics\n(LOTF-MD) driven by machine-learned interatomic potentials\nwith automated density functional theory (DFT) retraining to\ncapture the rare transition events of multivalent ions.28 A\nlayered material, BiOCl, which has been characterized and\ncomputed as an effective Mg", "start_char_idx": 3469, "end_char_idx": 7239, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d943e47-3d30-4cdf-8cc8-9af3d1b175ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d943e47-3d30-4cdf-8cc8-9af3d1b175ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dbc00837-03d4-40b7-bdc2-9982b9e269ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "f359bcdb811c7903c4bd92d25c0171388c010cd08981634fafa6a73bbbcc2225"}, "2": {"node_id": "8441abbd-500d-4285-9c81-22e7735b7fd1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7cbe17b9e95048bf632d291fb9ca719d298b8685b01754b7ea540c2e28b75a6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b51636a-3e55-489d-a18b-d21304b6de09", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "25daeda0cbf46a530072da5a30cdabc84c0002656e513594c40d1d1bdbf619b5"}}, "hash": "c5ec807182ce689c137f4c63c66e04bd693c4fb3c85f776b4d4bddeced8bb99f", "text": "material, BiOCl, which has been characterized and\ncomputed as an effective Mg anode protection layer in our\nrecent study,12 was selected as a representative host material\nfor this investigation.\nEnabled by the computational efficiency of the LOTF-MD\nmethod, we simulated atomic dynamics at nanosecond (ns)\ntimescales, which revealed highly cooperative motion of Mg\nand Cl ions that facilitates Mg2+ transfer in the BiOCl/MgCl+\nsystem.

METHODS\n2.1. Density Functional Theory. To simulate ionic dynamics in\nthe layered structures, we performed ground-state structural\noptimization and AIMD simulations at elevated temperatures using\nVienna Ab-initio Simulation Package29 and the projector augmented\nwave approach.30 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1 supercells of BiOCl, ScOCl, and BiOBr\nwere constructed from the Materials Project31 structure entries mp22939, mp-989195, and mp-23072, respectively, with one embedded\nMg2+ or MgCl+ (MgBr+ in BiOBr), followed by full geometry\noptimizations with a plane wave energy cutoff of 520 eV and a 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7\n2 Monkhorst\u2212Pack k-point mesh. The charged cell was compensated\nby a uniform jellium background of opposite charge. Supercells were\nconstructed to ensure there was at least a 9 \u00c5 separation between\nneighboring images32 to avoid periodic boundary effects. The relaxed\nlattice parameters were then used as an initial geometry for the\nsubsequent AIMD simulations. In line with previous publications,32,33\nthe calculation parameters of AIMD were selected to balance accuracy\nversus computational cost. We used a plane wave energy cutoff of 400\neV and a minimal \u0393-point-only k-point mesh. The AIMD simulations\nwere carried out at 1000 K using the NVT ensemble. Additionally, the\nlattice expansion of BiOCl resulting from MgCl+ intercalation was\ninvestigated with AIMD using the NPT ensemble under 1 atm\npressure for 160 ps. The temperature control for NVT-AIMD\nsimulations and NPT-AIMD simulations was achieved by using the\nNose\u0301 thermostat34,35 and Langevin thermostat,36,37 respectively. In\nboth 0 K geometry optimization and AIMD simulations, van der\nWaals interaction was approximated by applying the DFT-D3 method\nwith Becke\u2212Johnson damping.38,39\n2.2.

After updating the training set, the MTP was retrained,\nand the molecular dynamics run was restarted with the improved\npotentials. Details of MTP training, including the size of polynomial\nbasis, cut-off radius for the local atomic environment, and the\ndefinition of extrapolation threshold, are provided in the Supporting\nInformation Section S1. By sampling the configurational space\niteratively, MTP eventually becomes sufficiently accurate for the\nentire energy landscape that it no longer acquires additional training\ndata to complete nanosecond long molecular dynamics production.\nThe use of this iterative scheme enables us to gather orders of\nmagnitude more data than can be accessed by direct AIMD with little\nloss of accuracy, resulting in reduced statistical variance in the\nestimated diffusivity, which especially benefits the prediction of\nstructures with medium-to-high diffusion barriers. DFT validation of\nMTP predicted energies and forces, as well as experimental\nbenchmark results of diffusion barriers in various crystalline\nstructures, are reported in a recent study.44 We performed DFT\nvalidation of the fitted MTP on configurations that are not included in\nthe training set, as described in Section S1.

The cooperative motion of Mg and\nCl ions in BiOCl/MgCl+ is demonstrated at 1000 K at 2, 4,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere 2r(t ) is the mean square displacement (MSD) of Mg atom\nafter time t, and the constant 6 is used for three-dimensional diffusion.\nMD simulation temperature was decremented by 50 K until the\ndiffusivity of Mg was so low that no site-to-site hopping of Mg was\ndetected within 20 ns. (Figure 1) The temperature-dependent\ndiffusivities were used to fit the Arrhenius relationship\nD(T ) = D( ) e Ea / kBT\n\nArticle\n\n(2)\n\nWe denote the estimated tracer diffusivity at temperature T as\nD(T). The activation energy, Ea, can be calculated from a linear fit of\nlog(D(T)) to 1 , where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant. As demonstrated\nkBT\n\nby He et al.,45 the variance in the independent variable D should be\nconsidered when fitting the Arrhenius equation for a statistically\nmeaningful estimation of Ea. Following their method, we estimated\nthe variance in the diffusivity of Mg ions and propagated to the\nvariance in the activation barrier Ea. These variances were then used in\na weighted least-squares regression to estimate Ea. The equation for\nvariance calculation and weighted least-squares regression are\nprovided in Section S2.\n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n3.1. Diffusion of Mg ion Carrier MgCl+ Versus Mg2+ in\nBiOCl.

The warmer color represents the Cl ion closer to the Mg ion, while the cooler,\nthe farther to the Mg ion.\n\nwe manually expanded the lattice of the BiOCl/Mg2+ cell to\nmatch that of BiOCl/MgCl+ and performed LOTF-MD. No\nrotational motion of Cl ions was observed in the expanded\nBiOCl/Mg2+ system, which indicates that the presence of the\nMg\u2212Cl ion complex is critical to the cooperative diffusion\nbehavior and enhanced Mg diffusion. There has recently been\na growing interest in the study of the correlation between\ncooperative motion and enhanced ionic diffusion, such as the\nmultivalent ion intercalation in the cathode,46,47 as well as Liion diffusion in solid electrolyte materials.48\u221251 While intrinsic\ncooperative motion is commonly observed in several types of\nLi-ion superconductors, the cooperative motion of multivalent\nions usually requires externally introduced ions.46,52,53 To our\nknowledge, this is the first time the characteristic mechanism of\nMg diffusion facilitated by synchronous anion motion in the\nlayered oxyhalide host structure has been identified. The\natomistic insight improves the understanding of how tailoring\n\nand 6 ns in Figure 3. It suggests the spatial correlation between\nthe rotational motion of Cl ions and Mg diagonal site-to-site\nhopping behavior. We further probe the temporal correlation\nbetween Mg and the motion of Cl anions in the system by\ntracking the movement of each atom with time. We compute\nCl displacement at each time step over the course of 6 ns MD\nproduction and color code based on their distance to Mg in\nFigure 4. The result suggests large displacement undergone by\nmultiple Cl anions is in sync with a short Mg\u2212Cl distance\nthroughout the 6 ns trajectory. The radial distribution function\n(RDF) and the coordination number analysis of Mg\u2212Cl in\nFigure S1 indicate Mg is usually coordinated with five Cl\nanions.

This\ncould be explained by the concerted motion of Mg and Cl ions\nidentified by LOTF-MD, which was not captured in the CINEB calculations.\n3.3. Diffusion of Mg Species in Layered Oxyhalide\nStructures. Considering the cooperative diffusion mechanism\nobserved in the BiOCl/MgCl+ system, there is likely a family of\nstructures where Mg diffusion is facilitated by the concerted\ncation\u2212anion motion. To investigate analogous structures in\nthe materials space, we perform a material screening of the\nMaterials Project database31 with compositional and structural\nsearching criteria illustrated in Figure 6. We identified 91\n\nthe ion carrier for a specific host lattice can lead to improved\nionic conduction.\n3.2. Interlayer Expansion of Host Lattice BiOCl. The\nanalysis of Mg diffusivity shown in Figure 2 was performed\nwith molecular dynamics in the NVT ensemble with the lattice\ndimension fixed at that of the ground state of BiOCl with\nMgCl inserted. In many cases, the battery components, in\nparticular layered materials, are likely to expand notably in the\ndimension of charge carrier intercalation. To investigate the\nlattice expansion caused by MgCl+ insertion, we perform\nAIMD in the NPT ensemble under 1 bar pressure at 1000 K.\nDuring the 160 ps AIMD equilibration, the vertical lattice\nexpanded from 7.7 to 8.6 \u00c5. In the expanded lattice, the MgCl+\nion complex has more free space for diffusion, which may lead\nto a lower diffusion barrier. To investigate this hypothesis and\nquantify the effect of lattice expansion on diffusion kinetics, we\ncomputed the activation energy (Ea) of Mg diffusion from\nvalues of diffusivity observed at 750\u22121050 and 700\u22121050 K in\nthe simulation cell of the original lattice and the expanded\nlattice, respectively. The Arrhenius plot of two sets of\ndiffusivity values is shown in Figure 5. With the interlayer\n\nFigure 6. Screening workflow for identification of layered oxyhalide\nstructures capable of Mg diffusion based on compositional and\nstructural features of BiOCl.\n\noxyhalide compounds, and from these, we searched for P4/\nnmm space group structures in layered configurations using the\nalgorithm developed by Cheon et al.54 Considering the\nrelatively long bond length of Bi\u2212Cl55 in BiOCl may have\ncontributed to the mobility of Cl anions, we require that the\nM\u2212X (X = Cl, Br) bond length is longer than the sum of the\ncovalent radii of the constituent atoms. Additionally, we\nrequire that +3 is among the common oxidation numbers of\nthe metal cation M.\nThis screening resulted in two candidate materials, BiOBr\n(mp-23072) and ScOCl (mp-989195), with high similarity to\nBiOCl in terms of the searching criteria. After inserting the\nguest ion MgBr+ and MgCl+ in BiOBr and ScOCl, respectively,\nwe performed LOTF-MD to evaluate Mg diffusivities and\nactivation energy barriers. Mg hopping coupled with halide-ion\nrotational motions, similar to that observed in BiOCl/MgCl+,\nwas observed in both candidate host structures.

The generated data\nwere used to construct an active learning model based on Bayesian\noptimization (BO) that targets candidates with desired oxidation\npotentials utilizing only a minimal number of DFT calculations. The\nactive learning model demonstrated not only signi\ufb01cant e\ufb03ciency\nimprovement over the random selection approach but also robust\ncapability in identifying desired candidates in an untested set of 112 000\nhomobenzylic ether molecules. Our \ufb01ndings highlight the e\ufb03cacy of\nquantum chemistry-informed active learning to accelerate the discovery\nof materials with desired properties from a vast chemical space.\n\n\u25a0\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRedox \ufb02ow batteries (RFBs) are a promising technology for\nstationary energy storage applications.1\u22124 Among the technical\nchallenges associated with nonaqueous redox \ufb02ow batteries\n(NRFBs) is their inability to achieve both a long calendar life\nand a long cycle life. Mechanisms of calendar aging mainly\ninvolve the formation of passivating \ufb01lms on positive and\nnegative electrodes.5,6 These \ufb01lms interfere with charge\ntransfer processes at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces.7\nOne likely cause of \ufb01lm formation is the irreversible adsorption\nof damaged redoxmers. To regenerate electrode interfaces and\nretain long-lifetime NRFBs, we seek to develop redoxmers that\nare capable of programmed destruction, thereby providing a\nmeans to remove undesirable \ufb01lm deposits. We envisioned a\ndesign concept in which redox-active cores are connected to a\nmolecular sca\ufb00old via a cleavable tether. By using a redoxtriggered cleavage reaction, the recreation of a pristine interface\nbecomes possible simply by altering the electrode\u2019s potential to\na value that is outside the battery\u2019s normal window of\noperation.\nMesolytic cleavage reactions are thermodynamically favorable bond dissociation processes that fragment a molecule into\nseparated radical and ion species following a single electron\noxidation or reduction event.8 In the context of designing\nsustainable NRFBs, we envision the fragmentation process to\nliberate the damaged redox-active cores allowing the deposited\nredoxmer to return to solution and restore the electrode\nsurface (Scheme 1). In the literature, many classes of molecular\nsca\ufb00olds such as alkoxyamines,9,10 aromatic disul\ufb01des,11 enol\ncarbonates,12 and haloacetonitriles13 have been reported to\n\u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society\n\nundergo mesolytic cleavage. Among these, homobenzylic\nethers (HBEs) are of practical interest as their mesolytic\ncleavage properties have been previously utilized for the\ndevelopment and applications of electron-transfer-initiated\nreactions.14 Therefore, HBE was chosen as the molecular\nsca\ufb00old for", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3451, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e64fc12-c5ec-488f-8568-e9ce3b00e193": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e64fc12-c5ec-488f-8568-e9ce3b00e193", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91707e26-87bb-4d4b-baaa-3fb95f6498e4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "066871efdbc531d5a7349e6df2a5c8bf6f5cfc5ea8a6f34f61aa5271a39b0fae"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e97b882-a92d-4568-8203-94d915348da3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4f9e157b26adf8e03804371ea0d4b12f3021cee4352ea6a83cc77dccc58a6fa9"}, "3": {"node_id": "acd1d75f-33ea-4d0c-88d5-648b4fc71f20", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a4184dc4ce75d56eef74ea258d2085c3c44ee5f4c7cc56a3aaedbce15bece264"}}, "hash": "e65f86d212ca34711ea532a06db7b6f76402bc52d043c8ea8656f6f2f7b99715", "text": "Therefore, HBE was chosen as the molecular\nsca\ufb00old for mesolytic cleavage motif in this work.\nFor a molecule to undergo mesolytic cleavage, it must \ufb01rst\nbe oxidized or reduced.

As shown in\nFigure 1a, an HBE sca\ufb00old with simple functional group\nvariations generates a set of 1400 molecular candidates\nthrough systematic enumeration. The experimental investigation of such a vast structural space is impractical, being both\ntime-consuming and expensive. In contrast, accurate quantum\nmechanical calculations, e.g., density functional theory (DFT),\nprovide an alternative to accelerate the screening process.15\u221217\nIndeed, it has been shown that DFT-computed redox\npotentials of organic molecules are in good agreement with\nexperimental measurements.18\u221220 For example, Davis and Fry\nperformed DFT simulations to compute reduction and\noxidation potentials for 51 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons\nReceived: February 21, 2020\nRevised: May 28, 2020\nPublished: May 28, 2020\n\n6338\n\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00768\nChem.

Recently,\nmachine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to\npredict various materials properties including crystal stability,21,22 di\ufb00usion barrier,23 band gap,24,25 melting point,26\nsuperconducting transition temperature,27 catalytic activity,28,29 and others.30,31 Consequently, ML o\ufb00ers an accelerated approach to materials screening and discovery from\nextensive molecular libraries.32\u221238 Compared to physics-based\ncalculations (e.g., DFT), ML models o\ufb00er a more e\ufb03cient\nmethod for materials exploration of very large search space.39\nHowever, a reliable supervised ML model such as regression\noften requires a substantial amount of training data, which\ntypically come from expensive simulations or a large number of\nexperiments. Active learning, on the other hand, constructs a\nself-improving cycle that dynamically queries new data for\nevaluation to maximize its predictive power. Thus, active\nlearning is most useful when data are scarce or di\ufb03cult to\nproduce, which is often the case in materials research. Indeed,\nsuccessful demonstrations of active learning applied to\n\nmaterials discovery have been highlighted across multiple\ndisciplines in the recent literature.40\u221246\nHere, we employed high-throughput DFT calculations and\nan active learning model based on Bayesian optimization (BO)\nto screen HBEs for the ideal design of redoxmers capable of\nprogrammed destruction.

Speci\ufb01cally, for potential compatibility with catholytes in NRFBs, it is desirable to select HBEs with an\noxidation potential (here noted as Eox implying that mesolytic\ncleavage is initiated by the oxidation of the molecule) between\n1.40 and 1.70 V (vs NHE) for two primary reasons. First,\nmany catholytes including dialkoxybenzenes (DMB),47 anthraquinone, 48 and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl\n(TEMPO)49 have oxidation potentials below 1.40 V vs\nNHE, so they could be cycled without triggering HBE cleavage\nuntil the latter is wanted. Second, applying high oxidative\npotentials past 1.70 V is known to cause a breakdown in typical\nNRFB electrolytes and solvents, such as acetonitrile, which is\nused here for the calculation of Eox. With such criteria, we built\na library of HBEs and computed their corresponding oxidation\npotentials. Subsequently, we assessed a Gaussian process\nregression model for Eox prediction of HBEs as a potential\n6339\n\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00768\nChem.

Graphical illustration of the chemical space of 1400 HBEs and their computed oxidation potentials (Eox). PC-1 and PC-2 represent\nprinciple components 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nidenti\ufb01ed a total of 133 molecules with the desired Eox between\n1.40 and 1.70 V (Table S1), which constitutes ca. 9% of the\nentire HBE candidate library. From Table S1, we noted the\nmajority of the identi\ufb01ed HBEs possess either a methoxy\n(64%) or a phenyl functional group (35%) at the para position\nof the benzene ring in the sca\ufb00old (i.e., R3 = \u2212OMe or \u2212Ph in\nFigure 1a). Furthermore, for a randomly selected subset of 10\nHBEs, Table S2 shows the exergonic nature of bond\nfragmentations upon one-electron oxidation and indicates the\npresence of mesolytic cleavages among the identi\ufb01ed\nmolecules. A more rigorous redox-triggered mesolytic cleavage\nstudy employing both computations and experiments will be\ncarried out in the future.\nFeature Generation and Dimensionality Reduction.\nIn order to create an accurate model to predict Eox for HBEs,\nwe utilized an extensive set of physical and chemical\ndescriptors such as molecular weight, topological surface\narea, number of valence electrons, and number of aromatic\nrings. A total of 49 such features were generated automatically\nfrom SMILES inputs using RDKit and tabulated in Table S3.\nPearson correlation analysis indicates no single feature among\nthose 49 can reliably capture the trend of computed Eox\n(Figure S2 and Table S3). Therefore, to extract the key\ncomponents as well as reduce the dimensionality of our feature\nvector, we performed principle component analysis (PCA). In\nPCA, original feature components are combined linearly to\ncreate new features called principle components (PCs).

The systematic enumeration of HBEs with various\nfunctional groups (Rs) begins with a sca\ufb00old in the form of a\nSimpli\ufb01ed Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES)\nstring, namely, [R3]C1 = CC = C(C([R4])([R5])C([R2])[O][R1]) C = C1. Then, by substituting the R-designated\nresidues within the sca\ufb00old with the appropriate functional\ngroups (also in SMILES format), a total of ca. 1400 unique\nHBEs were generated (Figure 1a). Note that this is not an\nexhaustive collection of such functional groups. This initial set\nwas chosen primarily for their electron-donating and -withdrawing properties, as well as ease of synthesis. Overall, this\nHBE data set is diverse as the constituent molecules are\ncomposed of 10\u221239 heavy (i.e., non-hydrogen) atoms and \ufb01ve\nelements: C, H, O, N, and Br. To validate our computational\napproach, we compared DFT-derived oxidation potentials with\ncyclic voltammetry measurements for 11 HBE molecules from\nthe data set. The benchmarking results show a mean absolute\nerror of 0.11 V (Figure S1), indicating su\ufb03cient accuracy of\nour DFT method in computing oxidation potentials.

Such excellent predictive power of our\nGPR model provides us con\ufb01dence in constructing a Bayesian\noptimization model to identify HBE candidates with desirable\nEox, wherein GPR serves as the surrogate model.\nBayesian Optimization (BO) for Prediction of Materials with Desirable Oxidation Potentials. The goal of a BO\nprocess applied to computational materials screening is to\ne\ufb03ciently identify candidates with desired property while\nrequiring only a minimal number of expensive evaluations such\nas DFT calculations. At the beginning of a typical BO process,\na small, randomly selected number of the data points are used\nto train a surrogate model. Then, based on the predicted mean\nvalues and uncertainties obtained from the surrogate model,\nthe acquisition function optimizes the objective function by\nsuggesting the next data point(s) for evaluation. New labeled\ndata are used to improve the surrogate model and complete\none BO iteration.\n\nwith multiple aromatic rings such as 4-(2-phenoxy-1,1,2triphenylethyl)-1,1\u2032-biphenyl on the far right (6), Figure 2\nillustrates the structural and electrochemical diversity of our\nlibrary of 1400 HBEs.\nPrediction of Oxidation Potentials of Materials Using\nGaussian Process Regression. With the 15-PC feature\nvectors, we built a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model\nto predict the oxidation potentials51 of HBEs. GPR is a\nnonparametric (i.e., not limited to a functional form) approach\nto regression with the ability to provide uncertainty on the\npredictions. The statistically meaningful predictions are based\non a Bayesian framework, wherein a prior Gaussian process is\nformulated from training data and a covariance (or kernel)\nfunction. In this work, we used the Mate\u0301rn kernel, a\ngeneralization of the radial basis function, to construct the\ncovariance matrices (see Methods). Two metrics were used to\nevaluate the performance of the GPR models, namely, root\nmean squared error (RMSE) and coe\ufb03cient of determination\n(R2). Nine models were tested to determine the optimal train/\ntest ratio, and the resulting learning curve is shown in Figure\n3a. The construction of each model \ufb01rst involves selecting a\npercentage (between 10% and 90% in our case) of the entire\nlibrary of HBEs to serve as the training set. Then, the\nremaining molecules, which have not been seen by the model,\nare used as the test data set. In addition, a total of 100 runs\n(each run starting with a random training/test split) were\nrepeated for each model to build a reasonable statistic of the\nmodel performance.52 For comparison, similar learning curves\n6341\n\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.0c00768\nChem.

This GPR\nmodel was used to make predictions of Eox for the remaining\nHBE molecules in the library. Then, the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function utilized both the prediction and\nthe uncertainty to suggest the next best HBE candidate for\nDFT evaluation. The EI is a widely used state-of-the-art\nacquisition function that balances between exploitation\n(following the trend of the current best estimates) and\nexploration (diversifying the search to avoid local optima).\nOnce the Eox value of the new HBE was computed, it was\nadded to the current training data set to retrain the GPR model\nin the next iteration of the BO loop (Figure 4a, red). In order\nto evaluate the performance of BO on our HBE database, we\nprogrammed the BO cycle to repeat until a total of 30\nmolecules with Eox \u2208 [1.40 V, 1.70 V] are found. Based on the\nstatistics observed earlier, there is a 9% chance of \ufb01nding such\nan HBE molecule. This low probability is re\ufb02ected by the slope\nof the blue curve in Figure 4b, which was constructed by\nrandomly selecting HBEs in the database and recording the\nnumber of those with the desired Eox. Indeed, we found that it\nwould take approximately 330 random selections to \ufb01nd 30\ndesirable HBEs. In comparison, the same number of HBEs\nwere correctly selected within 60 BO evaluations. Since every\nrandom selection or BO evaluation requires a DFT calculation,\nFigure 4b indicates at least 5-fold improvement in e\ufb03ciency in\nidentifying appropriate candidates obtained from using BO\nover the random selection. Similar observation can be seen for\nthe comparison between BO and Latin hypercube sampling\n(Figure S6).\nWe further examined the generalizability of the BO process\nby applying it to a signi\ufb01cantly larger, previously unseen data\nset of approximately 112 000 HBEs. This new data set was\ncreated by incorporating a wider range of R-designated\nresidues to the HBE sca\ufb00old (Table S4). We conducted two\nindependent BO runs, BO1 and BO2, each with an initial\ntraining set of 10 randomly chosen HBEs and set the\nmaximum number of HBEs to evaluate to 40. With this\nsetup, both BO runs successfully discovered a number of HBE\nmolecules with the desired Eox (26 in BO1 and 16 in BO2),\nand the evaluation progress of BO1 is shown in Figure 5. It can\nbe seen that, after an initial exploration within the \ufb01rst 15\nsteps, BO1\u2019s predictive capability starts improving signi\ufb01cantly\nas the gap between the predicted and DFT-computed values\ndecreases rapidly. Table 1 shows several HBE candidates\ndiscovered by BO1 and their corresponding R-designated\nresidue identities. Interestingly, we notice that BO1 consistently identi\ufb01es desired HBEs with either a propoxy or isopropoxy functional group at the R3 position with respect to the\nsca\ufb00old (i.e., R3= \u2212OPr or \u2212OiPr) within 40 BO evaluations.\nSimilarly, we identi\ufb01ed 16 HBE molecules from BO2. These\nstructural patterns, together with those found previously in the\n133 molecules identi\ufb01ed from the 1400 data set, suggests the\npresence of electron donating groups such as alkoxy and\nphenyl at the para position for designing HBEs with oxidation\npotential window of [1.40 V, 1.70 V vs NHE].

Curtissa\n\nA priori catalyst design guidelines from \ufb01rst principles simulations and reliable data-driven models are\nessential for cost e\ufb03cient catalyst discovery. Nonetheless, acquiring all properties that control catalytic\nactivity and stability is computationally challenging due to the complex interactions among reactants,\nintermediates, and products at the active sites. Therefore, predictions of only the most relevant catalytic\nproperties, or catalyst descriptors, are often used to guide new catalyst design. In the context of\nupgrading biomass materials via deoxygenation reaction to value-added chemicals, the molybdenum\ncarbides (Mo2C) have been considered among the most active and economically viable catalysts.\nUnfortunately, one of the bottlenecks related to longer term stability of Mo2C catalysts is the\nsusceptibility to surface oxidation, a common problem in heterogeneous catalysis, which requires the\nuse of excess hydrogen for active site regeneration. By using surface dopants to tune the oxygen a\ufb03nity\n(catalyst descriptor) of Mo2C surfaces, it is possible to design new doped Mo2C catalysts with desired\nreactivity and stability. Here, we \ufb01rst employed periodic density functional theory to perform 20 000\nhigh-throughput VASP simulations of oxygen binding energies (BEO) on various pristine and doped Mo2C\nsurfaces. We computed and developed a binding energy database of 20 000 oxygen adsorption\nstructures consisting of 7 low Miller-index surfaces, 23 d-block elements as single-atom dopants, all\npossible surface terminations, dopant locations, and adsorption sites.

Nevertheless, the high cost of DFT calculations\nremains the bottleneck of high-throughput descriptor generation. To circumvent such problem, machine learning (ML)\nmodels utilizing existing DFT-computed datasets have been\ndeveloped to accelerate the prediction of catalytic descriptors\nsuch as binding energies,21\u201332 adsorption dynamics,33 d-band\ncenters,34 and activation energy barriers.35,36 Notably, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) previously employed for property\nprediction of molecules37\u201340 have been quickly adopted for\ncrystalline materials.41\u201344 Perhaps, an attractive feature of GNN\nover typical ML approaches is the use of neural graph \ue103ngerprint37 that enables the prediction and interpretation of global\nproperties based on local atomic contributions. To date, GNN\nframeworks such as message passing neural network (MPNN),45\ncrystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN),41 materials graph network (MEGNet),46 and SchNet47 provide \ue104exible\nmethods for training ML models to predict properties of various\nmaterials from isolated molecules to bulk crystals to catalytic\nsurfaces. For an in-depth review of these GNN models and their\nperformance benchmark, we refer the readers to a recent\npublication by Fung et al.48\nApplications of GNNs in computational heterogenous catalysis have been demonstrated recently via the prediction of\nbinding energies of various catalytic surface intermediates.43,49,50 For clarity and practicality, the following reported\nmean absolute errors (MAEs), an accuracy metric of MLpredicted values relative to DFT values, are for the predictions\non geometries prior to DFT optimization only (i.e., unrelaxed\ngeometries).

In Fig. 1a, up to two nearest-neighbour\ncoordination shells surrounding the adsorbed O atom are\naccounted for in our implementation as they have been previously shown to contribute signi\ue103cantly to the binding energy of\nsmall adsorbates.49 To determine whether there is a bond/edge\nto be included between two atoms/nodes in an LCG representation, we employ the following distance criterion:\ndij \u2212 (Ri + Rj) < D\n\n(2)\n\nwhere dij is the distance between the centres of atom i and atom\nj, Ri and Rj are the covalent radii of atom i and atom j, respectively. Thus, a bonded interaction between two atoms is\nconsidered if their skin-to-skin distance is smaller than D. For\nthe O/Mo2C catalyst models, D is chosen to be 0.25 \u00c5, as this\nvalue provides a stable count for the number of nearest neighbours to the adsorbed oxygen atom on optimized catalyst\nsurfaces (see Fig. S4\u2020).\nIn each LCG, nodes and edges are initially encoded with atom\nand bond features. Speci\ue103cally, element type, coordination\nnumber, atom type (adsorbate, 1st, or 2nd nearest neighbour),\nand list of neighbour atoms are used as atom features. For\nbonds, each is distinguished by type, distance, and the atom pair\nthat it connects. Two types of bonds are considered: adsorption\nbonds between O and a catalyst surface atom or lattice bonds\nbetween di\ufb00erent catalyst surface atoms. The connectivity\nmatrix, atom, and bond features form the inputs for the machine\nlearning model.

For the latter, as the dopant atom is\nfurther away from the adsorbed oxygen, negligible di\ufb00erences\ncompared to pristine Mo2C are observed (Fig. 3b). In contrast,\nthe presence of a dopant atom in the \ue103rst coordination shell can\nstrongly in\ue104uence the magnitude of BEO (Fig. 3a). Furthermore,\nwe observed that the presence of Zn, Cu, or Ni dopants weakens\nthe binding strength of oxygen atom on the catalytic facets,\nwhereas Cr, V, and Ti dopants strengthen the binding strength\nof oxygen atoms. In addition, a trend in BEO with respect to the\nposition of dopant element in the periodic table is observed. In\ngeneral, from le\ue09d to right, i.e., group IV to XII, and top to\nbottom, i.e., period 4 to 6, across the transition metals, the\nmagnitude of BEO decreases gradually.

Periodic DFT calculations\nhave been used to build a dataset containing optimized\nadsorption structures and their corresponding oxygen binding\nenergies (BEO). From the computed data, the BEO distribution\nindicates a strong dependence on the element of the dopant\natom in the \ue103rst nearest neighbour with respect to the adsorbed\noxygen. Furthermore, the results from high-throughput DFT\ncalculations indicate that Zn, Ni, and Cu dopants decrease the\nBEO on Mo2C surfaces and could be used to improve surface\nstability against oxidation during HDO reactions. It is noted that\nsurface oxidation of Mo2C is a dynamic and complex process in\nwhich other factors besides BEO such as atomic rearrangement,\ndopant di\ufb00usion, coverage e\ufb00ects, phase stability, and reducibility are also important and should be investigated with further\ncomputational and experimental studies. The high-\ue103delity DFT\ndataset was utilized to develop and train a message passing\nneural network using local coordination graph (LCG-MPNN) to\npredict BEO from a graph representation of the unoptimized\ngeometry. The deep learning model achieves a mean absolute\nerror of 0.176 eV for BEO on a test set of unoptimized adsorption\nstructures. Upon studying the learned graph representation of\noxygen adsorption on Mo2C, we identi\ue103ed that the local\narrangement of surface atoms plays an important role in determining BEO and the data-driven model can be used for a fast and\naccurate estimation of binding energies. Furthermore, the\ngradient calculation from atom feature inputs allows for recognizing feature importance with atomic precision at the oxygen\nbinding site. Our results highlight the use of LCG-MPNN as an\naccurate and broadly applicable machine learning approach for\nadsorption energy prediction for accelerated discovery of catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation and beyond.

In RFBs, energy is carried in \ufb02owable redoxactive materials (redoxmers) which are stored externally and pumped to\nthe cell during operation. Further improvements in the energy density of\nRFBs necessitates redoxmer designs with wider redox potential windows\nand higher solubility. Additionally, designing redoxmers with a\n\ufb02uorescence-enabled self-reporting functionality allows monitoring of\nthe state of health of RFBs. To accelerate the discovery of redoxmers\nwith desired properties, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML)\nmethods, such as multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MBO), are\nuseful. Here, we \ufb01rst employed density functional theory calculations to\ngenerate a database of reduction potentials, solvation free energies, and\nabsorption wavelengths for 1400 redoxmer molecules based on a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BzNSN) core structure. From the\ncomputed properties, we identi\ufb01ed 22 Pareto-optimal molecules that represent best trade-o\ufb00 among all of the desired properties. We\nfurther utilized these data to develop and benchmark an MBO approach to identify candidates quickly and e\ufb03ciently with multiple\ntargeted properties. With MBO, optimal candidates from the 1400-molecule data set can be identi\ufb01ed at least 15 times more\ne\ufb03ciently compared to the brute force or random selection approach. Importantly, we utilized this approach for discovering\npromising redoxmers from an unseen database of 1 million BzNSN-based molecules, where we discovered 16 new Pareto-optimal\nmolecules with signi\ufb01cant improvements in properties over the initial 1400 molecules. We anticipate that this active learning\ntechnique is general and can be utilized for the discovery of any class of functional materials that satis\ufb01es multiple desired property\ncriteria.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIncreasing energy demand requires the integration of\nintermittent renewable energy sources, such as solar and\nwind, with the electric grid to maintain a carbon-neutral\neconomy.1,2 This requires the development of long-duration\nstationary energy storage technologies. Redox \ufb02ow batteries\n(RFBs), utilizing either aqueous or nonaqueous electrolytes,\nare considered a promising strategy to address this\nchallenge.3\u22125 Nonaqueous RFBs (NRFBs) o\ufb00er several\nadvantages over their aqueous counterparts, such as a wider\nelectrochemical stability window and lower cost, thanks to the\nuse of organic solvents and cost-e\ufb00ective redox-active\nmolecules (redoxmers).6,7 However, the development of\nnext-generation NRFBs with high energy density and superior\ncycling performance is dependent on the discovery of new and\nimproved redoxmers, which poses a major challenge for\nmaterial design.\nSeveral properties need to be considered when designing\nredoxmer molecules for high-performance NRFBs.

For example, AL has been successfully\nused to guide the experiments to accelerate the discovery of\nnew shape-memory alloys with low thermal hysteresis from a\nsearch space of 800k compositions40 and to tune the measured\nelectrostrain of the Pb-free piezoelectric materials.41 Bassman\net al. used an AL model based on Bayesian optimization (BO)\nto discover layered materials with optimal band gaps.42\nSimilarly, Kim et al. used AL to search for polymers with\nhigh glass transition temperatures using few DFT evaluations.43 Recently, we used the BO framework to identify\nredoxmers with optimum oxidation potentials for application\nin NRFBs from a large search space of 112k molecules by\nperforming only 100 DFT calculations.44 While a speci\ufb01c\nproperty of redoxmers such as redox potential, solubility, or\neven \ufb02uorescence may be e\ufb03ciently identi\ufb01ed via singleobjective AL, it is always more desirable, albeit challenging, to\nsearch for redoxmers with multiple optimized properties.\nIndeed, while most of the applications of AL for materials\ndesign have been limited to the optimization of a single\nobjective/property of the materials, there are only a few\nexamples where AL has been successfully used for simultaneous optimization of two or more material properties.45\u221247 In\nparticular, Janet et al. used multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MBO) to accelerate the search for candidates with an\noptimal combination of two properties (i.e., redox potential\nand solubility) from a search space of 2.8 million transition\nmetal complexes for application in RFBs.45 Gopakumar et al.\ndemonstrated the superior performance of the AL strategy for\nsimultaneous optimization of two properties compared to\nrandom search across multiple data sets.46 Recently, Jablonka\net al. developed a novel multiobjective AL algorithm which\nsimultaneously optimizes three properties (i.e., adsorption free\nenergy, repulsion free energy of dimers, and radius of", "start_char_idx": 3492, "end_char_idx": 7074, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2511622a-338e-41cd-bfb8-f4cb9aa0cc48": {"__data__": {"id_": "2511622a-338e-41cd-bfb8-f4cb9aa0cc48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b6b837e-a28a-49f1-93c7-84e71d544a0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "13f42aeba1ee575d846b070d485cd589e41715eab2855b4ccff3259fceb070bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "ba7766c9-5949-4510-ac01-24fcba760f13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "8875637a945ead18b3bbc39d150bb612c96054fefa3f15fe7fee7ed8c31baa0f"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e17d826-fe56-4e7e-ae05-09745cf44320", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4a5c0687d1a2e232218cc4eb87644263404270935024a08c0b6256cf2ace695d"}}, "hash": "4a1d6912c9538bc662b4e8f93ab3ef9e085779bb5a301d92418363848b0c5bab", "text": "adsorption free\nenergy, repulsion free energy of dimers, and radius of gyration)\nof the polymer beads and e\ufb03ciently identify Pareto-optimal\ncandidates from a large search space of polymeric materials.47\nIn this work, we have developed an AL framework based on\nMBO to accelerate the search of desired redox-active\nmolecules for application in high-energy-density NRFBs.

Although the\nstability of anolyte molecules is also an important criterion for\ndesigning long-duration RFBs, it is a function of multiple\nfactors (redox potential window, solvation structure, reactivity\n\nprovide a cost-e\ufb03cient alternative to enable the design and\ndiscovery.\nTo accelerate the materials discovery, high-\ufb01delity density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to screen\nlarge molecular libraries and guide experiments toward the\nmost optimal candidate molecules.12\u221215 The computed\nproperties, such as redox potentials of the organic molecules,\nare observed to be in good agreement with the experimentally\nmeasured values using cyclic voltammetry.16\u221218 Thus, a\ncombination of molecular engineering and high-throughput\nDFT calculations is routinely used to identify redoxmer\ncandidates with desired redox potentials for application in\nNRFBs.16,19,20 For example, Pelzer et al. have performed highthroughput DFT calculations to screen molecules with desired\nreduction and oxidation potentials from a library of 4178\nmolecules.21 Similarly, DFT calculations have been used to\ndevelop linear regression models to predict the solubilities of\nthe organic molecules using the computed solvation free\nenergies and dipole moments of the molecules.22 While such\nhigh-throughput material-screening approaches are attractive,\nthe brute-force computational screening methods become\nintractable as the size of the search space grows beyond a few\nthousand candidates.\nThe recent emergence of data-driven and machine learning\n(ML) techniques has accelerated the screening of large search\nspaces for the identi\ufb01cation of molecules/materials with\ndesired properties. Several surrogate ML models have been\ndeveloped using experimental or DFT-computed data to\naccurately and rapidly predict material properties such as the\nband gap,23\u221225 lattice thermal conductivity,26 dielectric\nconstant,27 refractive index,28 thermodynamic stability,29\nmelting temperature,30 and defect formation energies.31,32\nThe prediction accuracy of the ML models typically depends\non the diversity and the quantity of data used for training the\nmodels. The generation of large quantities of high-\ufb01delity data\nis computationally expensive and time-consuming, which is\none of the major bottlenecks in the development of\ngeneralizable and robust ML models based on supervised\nlearning. Thus, the surrogate ML models perform well within\nthe domain of applicability and often fail for unseen data points\nwhich are outside the training domain.33,34 The a priori\nidenti\ufb01cation of the domain of applicability of such ML models\nis a challenging task. To circumvent this problem, multiple\nactive learning (AL) strategies have been proposed.35\u221239\nAL is a class of ML strategies in which a learning algorithm\ninteractively queries an information source (or a database) to\nlabel new data points with the desired outputs.

The use of the\nsimpli\ufb01ed molecular input line entry system (SMILES) allows\nfor fast and robust text-based enumeration, resulting in a data\nset of c.a. 1400 BzNSN molecules. This data set consists of\nseven chemical elements, H, Br, C, N, O, S, and F. The size of\nmolecules ranges from 20 to 36 heavy atoms (non-H atoms).\nBefore DFT evaluations, the initial 3D molecular structures are\nautomatically generated from SMILES representations and\nsubsequently optimized using the MMF94 force\ufb01eld as\nimplemented in the RDKit cheminformatics package.48 Then,\nDFT calculations are performed to compute the reduction\npotentials (Ered), solvation free energies (Gsolv), and absorption\nwavelengths (\u03bbabs) of the molecules (see the Computational\nDetails section). The distributions of the computed Ered, Gsolv,\nand \u03bbabs values of the 1400 BzNSN molecule data set are\nshown in Figure 1b\u2212d, respectively. The computed properties\nare observed to vary over a wide range of values, indicating a\ndiverse data set of molecular properties. As shown in Figure 1b,\nthe computed reduction potential (Ered) varies in the range of\n\u223c1.5 to \u223c3.0 V vs Li/Li+. As shown in Figure 1c, the computed\nsolvation free energy (Gsolv) varies in the range of \u22121.2 to \u22120.2\neV.

We note that the actual solubility\nmeasurements using computations are not possible due to the\nlack of sublimation energies of the molecular materials.

To build robust ML models for\nproperty prediction, it is critical to design features/\ufb01ngerprints\nto numerically represent each molecule. It is also important to\nrecognize that the generated features should uniquely\nrepresent the molecule and should be easy to compute for\nany new molecule. Here, we use the RDKit cheminformatics\npackage48 to generate such a set of 125 features using various\nphysical and chemical properties of the molecules (see Table\nS1 of the Supporting Information). Based on the Pearson\ncorrelation analysis, we identi\ufb01ed that no single feature among\nthe original 125 features can reliably capture the trend of the\ncomputed Ered, Gsolv, or \u03bbabs values (Figures S2\u2212S4). After\nfeature normalization, we performed principal component\nanalysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature\nvector. From PCA, a total of 22 principal components (PCs)\nare found to be su\ufb03cient to account for 100% variance in the\ndata (see Figure S5 of the Supporting Information). The\ngraphical illustration of the chemical space of the 1400 BzNSN\n\nneous optimization of multiple properties requires the\nidenti\ufb01cation of the Pareto front, in which the Pareto-optimal\ndata points represent the best trade-o\ufb00 among properties.\nHere, we have used an AL strategy based on MBO to\naccelerate the search of the Pareto-optimal data points while\nutilizing a minimal number of expensive DFT calculations.\n2.2. Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization. MBO is a\nclass of multiobjective optimization in which a surrogate\nmodel, for example, Gaussian process regression (GPR, see the\nComputational Details section), is used to search for the\noptimal candidates based on improvement metrics such as the\nexpected improvement (EI, see the Computational Details\nsection). By de\ufb01ning how the EI of a multiobjective function\nmay be evaluated, several methods have been proposed in the\nrecent literature. In one approach by Knowles, called ParEGO,\nN objectives are aggregated into a single objective via\nparameterized scalarizing weight factors, and a single-objective\nEI is then used for the resulting single-objective function.49\nFurther modi\ufb01cations of ParEGO for improved computational\nspeed and e\ufb03ciency were also proposed by Liu et al.50 and\nZhang et al.51 Recently, Ha\u0308se and colleagues introduced a new\nlexicographical approach to combine multiple objectives into\none, in which the contribution from each objective is based on\nits hierarchical order of importance.52 In the case where\nobjective aggregation is not preferred, either a multipleobjective EI or multiple single-objective EIs must be evaluated\nwith respect to a Pareto front. For example, Keane derives a\ntwo-objective EI equation that computes the probability of\naugmenting the current Pareto front so that a new dominating\nsolution can be determined.53 The magnitude of improvement\nis then calculated with respect to the closest point on the\ncurrent Pareto front. In another approach, the improvement\nmetrics is de\ufb01ned by the S-metric or hypervolume increment\nto the Pareto front and can be computed using the EI in the\nhypervolume formulation.54,55 In general, multiobjective EI\nequations are mathematically complex and may not be easily\nexpanded to large number of objectives (Nobjective > 2). A\npossible approach to circumvent such di\ufb03culty is to employ\nmultiple single-objective EI equations. As shown by Jeong and\nObayashi, for every candidate, an EI will be computed for each\nobjective, and the resulting set of EIs is treated as \ufb01tness values\nfor selecting the optimal candidate.56 Beyond MBO, it is\nimportant to mention that Jablonka and co-workers recently\nproposed a novel multiobjective AL algorithm that optimizes\ntoward the Pareto front by directly using", "start_char_idx": 17291, "end_char_idx": 21029, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "89e21d15-93aa-4b8c-91cf-6ace9affc3f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "89e21d15-93aa-4b8c-91cf-6ace9affc3f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b6b837e-a28a-49f1-93c7-84e71d544a0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "13f42aeba1ee575d846b070d485cd589e41715eab2855b4ccff3259fceb070bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "96ddba7f-c1c5-4b5f-9af1-d6f1c159b65e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "b0eac1eadd0de7d058d371352b1e29bba9591849d003fdd896ef2b749a333cd6"}, "3": {"node_id": "be2d53c7-8b83-46d7-bbf3-ed4bfaf98f54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c9734ccb40dc280c92a892ae35f8641ea7fbde14d9a8f8e9caf96a32c3f53ec6"}}, "hash": "ea7f297c96650ce9a26a6563c8f8e5c160a2349d7bf7f436a30404589c2f55d9", "text": "AL algorithm that optimizes\ntoward the Pareto front by directly using the GPR-predicted\nmean and uncertainty values.47 In this work, we employ a\n8136\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.1c02040\nChem.

The 2D chemical structures and the computed\nproperties (Ered, Gsolv, and \u03bbabs) of these Pareto-optimal\nmolecules are summarized in Table 2 (IDs: 1\u221222). To\nevaluate the performance of our MBO approach, we performed\n100 iterations (equivalent to 100 molecule property evaluations) on the 1400 BzNSN data set. After every iteration, the\nnext molecule is suggested using the single-point selection\nmethod based on the crowding distance as described in Figure\n4c. We also repeat the procedure 100 times, each using a\ndi\ufb00erent initial training set of 10 randomly selected data points,\nto obtain meaningful statistics.\nA well-known metric for evaluating the performance of\nMBO methods is the hypervolume indicator, which is the\nvolume enclosed by connecting the Pareto-optimal points to a\nchosen reference point in the multiobjective space.47,60 For\ncomputing the hypervolumes, we use a reference point\nconsisting of three components, each of which is slightly\nlarger than the extremum (maximum) in each property\nred\nsolv\nsolv\ndimension, that is, Ered\nref > Emax (3.38 V), Gref > Gmax (\u22120.29\n61\nsolv\nsolv\neV), \u03bbref > \u03bbref (487 nm). As di\ufb00erent solution sets/Pareto\nfronts yield di\ufb00erent hypervolume values, they can be directly\nused for comparison. Typically, a higher hypervolume indicates\na better set of Pareto-optimal points, and it follows that the\ntrue Pareto front corresponds to the maximum hypervolume.\nFor the 1400 BzNSN data set, we can calculate the maximum\nhypervolume as the true Pareto front has been identi\ufb01ed. Using\nthe maximum hypervolume as the target, the performance of\nour MBO can be benchmarked against random selection.\nFigure 5b shows the hypervolume percentage (with respect to\nthe maximum hypervolume) obtained by MBO and random\nselection as a function of the number of evaluations. Two\nobservations can be made from Figure 5b. First, based on the\nshaded areas, which indicate 1\u03c3 around the mean, MBO\nprovides more stable solution sets compared to random\nselection. Second, the Pareto-optimal molecules suggested by\nMBO reach the quality of the true Pareto front at a\nsigni\ufb01cantly faster pace than their randomly selected counterparts.

Application of MBO on an Unseen Molecule Data\nSet of 1 Million BzNSNs. To demonstrate the robustness and\ngeneralizability of the MBO approach, we applied it to a\nsigni\ufb01cantly larger and new molecular data set. This new data\nset was generated by expanding the molecular candidate library\n(similar to Figure 1b) with more diverse substituents (\u201cR\u201d\npositions) in the molecular sca\ufb00old. The complete list of\nfunctional groups used for the generation of this large\nmolecular data set is provided in Table S3 of the Supporting\nInformation. We limit the maximum number of heavy atoms\n(non-H atoms) in the molecules to 40 to maintain a reasonable\ncomputational cost for DFT calculations. The \ufb01nal data set\nconsists of 1 million BzNSN molecules. Our goal is to discover\nnew Pareto-optimal molecules that potentially outperform the\n\nfor reduction potential, 57 meV for solvation free energy, and\n15 nm for absorption wavelength. The parity plots (i.e., GPRpredicted property vs DFT-computed property) comparing the\nperformance of the \ufb01nal GPR models trained with 70%\ntraining data using 22 PCs as the feature vector are shown in\nFigure 3d\u2212f.

The high R2 coe\ufb03cients of 0.94, 0.87, and\n0.82 on the test set for the reduction potential, solvation free\nenergy, and absorption wavelength, respectively, indicate the\ngood accuracy of the trained GPR models.\n2.2.3. Candidate Selection Using the Pareto-Optimal EI.\nIn single-objective BO, the current optimal (e.g., minimum or\nmaximum) value in the training set is used as the reference for\ncomputing the improvement metrics associated with the\ncandidates in the test data set. With EI formulation, the\ncandidate with the maximum EI value yields the maximum\npotential to improve over the existing reference and is selected\nfor evaluation. In the case of MBO, however, the Pareto front\nin the training set dictates the choice of the reference value(s).\nAll members of a Pareto front are considered equivalent, and\nan improvement over any one of them will warrant a new\nPareto front. Hence, the choice of which Pareto-optimal point\nshould be the reference value is a matter of strategic\npreference. In this work, as shown in Figure 4, we choose\nthe data point with the maximum, nonin\ufb01nite, crowding\ndistance (see the Computational Details section) on the Pareto\nfront of the training data set as the reference for EI evaluations\n(the solid red circle in Figure 4a).\nAs the Pareto-optimal reference is identi\ufb01ed, the improvement region over this point in the property space may be\nexplored as indicated in Figure 4b. This reference point and\nthe GPR-predicted mean and uncertainty values of the test set\nare then used to compute the EI values for every property.\nThus, we obtain a multidimensional improvement metrics with\nthe same number of dimensions as the property space (here, it\nis three dimensions).

All DFT calculations were carried\nout using Gaussian 16 software64 at the wb97xd/6-31+G(d,p)65,66 level of theory. The geometries of the molecules in\nthe neutral and reduced charge states were optimized, and\nfrequency calculations were performed to compute the Gibbs\nfree energies at 298 K. The SMD continuum model67 with\nacetonitrile as the solvent medium was used to compute the\nsolvation free energies. The reduction potentials (Ered, Li/Li+)\nof the molecules were calculated using the change in the Gibbs\nfree energy in the solution medium at 298 K upon the addition\nof one e\u2212 to the neutral molecule (\u0394Gred = Greduced \u2212 Gneutral),\nas given by eq 1.\n\nset suggested by our MBO from the 1 million BzNSN data set.\nThe 2D structures and properties of these 16 molecules are\ntabulated in Table S5 (BzNSN 23-38, see the Supporting\nInformation). Among the new Pareto-optimal molecules, two\nnew extrema are identi\ufb01ed for Ered and Gsolv in BzNSN 34 and\n37, respectively, and both provide signi\ufb01cant improvement\nover the previous desired limits (1.54 V \u2192 1.30 V and \u22121.19\n\u2192 \u22121.69 eV). For the third objective, in which \u03bbabs is targeted\ntoward 375 nm, no improvement is found since the existing\nextremum is already near the desired value (BzNSN 15 with\n\u03bbabs = 374.98). Importantly, we identify four MBO-suggested\nmolecules from the 1 million BzNSN data set, as shown in\nFigure 7 (BzNSN ID 26, 29, 33, and 35), that possess both\nlower Ered and lower Gsolv values compared to the entire 1400\nBzNSN data set while maintaining the \u03bbabs in the desirable\nrange of 350\u2212400 nm (|\u03bbabs \u2212 375| \u2264 25).

CONCLUSIONS\nThe discovery of new and improved organic materials is\nessential for developing the RFB technology, and atomistic\nsimulations and AI-based approaches can provide design\nguidelines to accelerate materials development. For NRFB\ntechnology, molecules must satisfy multiple criteria such as\nredox potential windows, solubility, stability, rheology,\nconductivity, and other self-reporting/-repairing properties.\nIn this work, high-throughput DFT calculations were \ufb01rst\ncarried out to evaluate the reduction potentials, solvation free\nenergies, and absorption wavelengths of 1400 BzNSN\nmolecules to search for the ideal anolyte redoxmers for\nNRFBs. Twenty-two Pareto-optimal BzNSN molecules that\nbest compromise all three properties were identi\ufb01ed and\nsuggested for experimental validation. To accelerate the\ndiscovery of the Pareto-optimal candidates while keeping the\ncomputational cost minimal, an AL model based on MBO was\ndeveloped and benchmarked on the 1400 BzNSN molecule\ndata set. The results indicate at least a 15-fold e\ufb03ciency\nimprovement over random selection in searching the optimal\nmolecules. Finally, when applied to a new molecular data set\nconsisting of 1 million BzNSNs, our MBO quickly identi\ufb01ed\n16 new Pareto-optimal molecules with signi\ufb01cant property\nimprovement over the 1400 BzNSN data set.

To predictably restore device and materials performance, it is\ndesirable to add programmed destruction capabilities into these damage-prone materials. Here, we\nreport the use of triggerable retrograde reactions to achieve programmable end-of-life function in\nredoxmers. Retrograde reactions are intended to break up damaged redoxmer materials into more\nsoluble small-molecule constituents to prevent irreparably fouling battery interfaces. We investigated the\nredox-triggered mesolytic cleavage of homobenzylic ethers (HBEs) for this purpose. Combining\nexperimental methods with simulations, we probed the in\ufb02uence of ring substituents on the\nprogrammable bond-scission behavior of HBEs. Variation of para-substituents on the HBEs allowed us to\nmodify the oxidation potential, degradation pathway, and electrochemical mechanisms of the generated\nproducts. Given its ideal oxidation potential, we selected the para-methoxy-based HBE as the cleavage\nsca\ufb00old and integrated it with dialkoxybenzene, TEMPO, viologen, and para-nitrobenzene redox centers\nfor compatibility, bulk deconstruction, and electrode defouling tests.

For instance, defects in the formation of solid electrolyte\ninterphase layers at Li-ion battery anodes lead to capacity fade\nand power loss,4 and the precipitation of vanadium electrolytes\nin redox \ue104ow batteries (RFBs) causes blockages in the stacks and\npumps that suppress the energy density and capacity of RFBs.5\nFor these systems it would be desirable to develop a strategy that\nrelies on conditionally activating an intrinsic redox response that\nwould help dealing with irreversible damage.\nRedoxmers, alternative RFB electrolytes incorporating\nmultiple copies of redox-active units into a single molecule, are\nof great interest for size-exclusion RFBs.15 These redoxmers are\nalso known to produce insoluble species in extreme electrochemical environments. Damaged or overcharged redoxmers\npassivate the electrodes, foul separator membranes, and\ncontaminate electrolyte solutions, thus lowering the energy\nstorage e\ufb03ciency, overall performance, and long-term operation (Scheme 1a).16,17 Early intervention via a restoration regime\nwould halt the deterioration of power and storage capacities\nbefore system failure. We imagined the need to add new functionality that enables programmable deconstruction of\nredoxmers that reverts them back to their small-molecule\nconstituents,18 which would be more soluble in electrolytes\nand limit precipitation of blocking \ue103lms.

This results in the formation of one radical\nand one ion.22 There have been many molecular sca\ufb00olds reported that undergo mesolytic cleavage, such as alkoxyamines,23\u201326 aromatic disul\ue103des,27 benzylic thioethers,28,29 enol\ncarbonates,30 haloacetonitriles,31 and others.32\u201335 Synthetic chemists have utilized these cleavage reactions for various purposes,36,37\nsuch as in situ carbocation generation for organic\nsynthesis,24,25,28,37 single-molecular conductance control via electrostatic cleavage,38 synthesis of terminal functionalized polymers,39 and photo-controlled cationic polymerization via\nmesolytic cleavage of dithioester chain transfer agents.40,41 Mesolytic cleavage of homobenzylic ethers (HBEs, Scheme 1b), were\n\ue103rst investigated by Arnold et al.,42,43 then exploited by Floreancig\nand others,44 who developed electron-transfer-initiated cyclization\nreactions using mesolytic cleavage of HBEs.45\u201349\nBy utilizing the fundamental reaction step of mesolytic bond\ncleavage, we imagined redoxmer architectures in which an HBE\nsca\ufb00old is appended with redox-active pendant groups.

Additionally, the\nexperimental reduction potentials di\ufb00er greatly (up to 500 mV\nmore negative) from the predicted potentials (Table S2\u2021),\nindicating that either these products undergo a secondary\nchemical step or they are strongly dependent on solvent and\nelectrolyte interactions that are not accurately predicted by our\nmodelling. Previous studies on the electrooxidation of pmethoxytoluene have shown that aryl\u2013aryl coupling can occur\nbetween oxidized methoxybenzene species in non-aqueous\nconditions, where two radical cations couple followed by\ndeprotonation.61 This was shown to occur on the 10\u00015 s\ntimescale, which indicates a moderately high kinetic barrier to\nthis process.

Moreover, the oxidation of cleavage moieties should\nnot chemically or electrochemically interfere with the redoxactive unit's charge and discharge. To demonstrate this, we\nappended four di\ufb00erent redox active moieties to dimer systems\nbased on HBE 2: two catholytes, TEMPO and a dialkoxybenzene\n(DAB),62 and two anolytes, ethyl viologen (Vio)kk and paranitrobenzene (NP) (Fig. 3). The DAB redox potential is su\ufb03ciently negative (0.5 V negative compared to HBE 2) so that the\nHBE is not cleaved under normal cycling conditions, while the\nremaining three are signi\ue103cantly more negative than the\ncleavage potential for the HBE linkage.\nTo initially judge the chemical and electrochemical\ncompatibility of these redoxmers and HBEs, we tested these\nspecies at slow (#100 mV s\u00011) and fast ($1 V s\u00011) scan rates.\nScanning slowly allows time ($4 s here) for potential chemical\nprocesses (redoxmer deactivation by HBE products, \ue103lm\nformation, etc.) to occur a\ue09der HBE cleavage, as products are\nreleased into solution from the electrode surface.

Here we incorporated cleavable\nHBE linkers into both branched and main-chain RAPs to evaluate their programmable deconstruction at electrode interfaces\nand in bulk solutions.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we \ue103rst took a well-studied viologenappended polystyrene (PB-Vio) as a control RAP and inserted\na p-methoxy HBE linker between the Vio center and the polystyrene backbone to obtain a cleavable RAP (PB-Vio-HBE)\n(Fig. 5a). PB-Vio is known to deposit \ue103lms on the electrode\nsurface when overcharged (i.e., accessing potentials negative\nenough to reduce Vio2+ to Vio0). While these \ue103lms mediate\ncharge transfer with solution species, \ue103lms that are too thick\nimpede electron transfer rates and reduces the power output of\nthe battery over time.65 The ability to remove these \ue103lms periodically would provide simple way to maintain cells without\nreplacing the electrode (Fig. 5c). We individually electrodeposited PB-Vio-HBE and PB-Vio RAPs on electrode surfaces to\ngenerate \ue103lms with similar thickness for proof-of-concept\ndefouling tests (Fig. S17\u2021). To understand the e\ufb00ect of polymer architecture on defouling behavior, we also synthesized\nand tested main-chain viologen polymers with (PM-Vio-HBE)\nand without (PM-Vio) HBE linkers within the backbone (Fig. 5b).\nFilmed electrodes were defouled under two conditions:\napplication of positive potentials (Eox) that will oxidize HBE\nlinkers, and solution convection underneath the \ue103lmed electrode, which imitate the e\ufb00ect of potential and \ue104ow in an RFB,\nrespectively. Film content was quanti\ue103ed by integrating the\ncharge from CVs of the Vio-containing RAP \ue103lm (Fig. S18 and\nS19\u2021). For PB-Vio-HBE, immediately applying Eox for 3 seconds\nhas little e\ufb00ect on removing the \ue103lm; only convection directly\nfollowing \ue103lm oxidation leads to the decrease of the \ue103lm viologen content, though not by more than 30% (Fig. 5d and f).\nAdditionally, there is no signi\ue103cant di\ufb00erence between the\npolymer with HBE and without HBE, indicating that although\nsome HBEs are oxidized (likely just what is near the electrode\nsurface and can transfer electrons), it does not disrupt the\npolymer \ue103lm. This holds true for thin (one electrodeposition\ncycle, Fig. 5d) and thick \ue103lms (ten electrodeposition cycles,\nFig. S18\u2021), showing a fundamental limit of removal for this\nspeci\ue103c viologen polymer structure.

This system can utilize size-exclusion\nmembranes to separate redox centers from organic backbones, and ideally would allow chemistries for redoxmer regeneration via the reappending of intact redox centers to the backbone and injecting the regenerated redoxmer solution back into the primary system.

Note: the schematic\nredoxmer cartoon represents a universal programmable architecture rather than a single branched one.\n\nmorphology \u2013 plays a signi\ue103cant role in electrode passivation\nwith RAP adsorption and how easily those \ue103lms can be\nremoved. Second, HBE incorporation into RAPs in this initial\nform plays a trivial role in \ue103lm removal. As alluded to above, this\nis likely due to the fact only the HBE linkers near the electrode\nsurface (within the \ue103rst few nanometers) are oxidized. Since the\nether linkage cleaves rapidly, there is little time for the oxidative\ncharge to percolate out further in the \ue103lm before a \u201cdead layer\u201d\nof cleaved polymer forms on the electrode surface. This is evidenced by the persistence of the viologen signal even a\ue09der\nmultiple removal treatments. Third, the removal of these\nparticular Vio-containing RAPs is mostly driven by convection\nand electrostatic desorption, as evidenced by Fig. 5g where the\nPM-Vio is removed almost as much as PM-Vio-HBE a\ue09der applying\nEox. This suggests another design strategy for \ue103lm removal: nonfaradaic desorption caused by charge repulsion between the\nbackbone of the polymer and the electrode surface. All of these\ndiscoveries can direct future RAP design with or without\ncleavage chemistries to improve electrode longevity.\nBeyond the removal of thin \ue103lms from electrode interfaces,\nwe investigated the deconstruction of HBE-containing RAPs in\nbulk solutions and how they would interact with other RFB\ncomponents, namely the separator membrane between catholyte and anolyte compartments (Fig. 6a).

To maximize energy density, the redoxmer concentration\nneeds to be maximized while maintaining low viscosity and high ionic conductivity. During charge, a\nredoxmer molecule pairs with an ion in the electrolyte while another ion migrates across the membrane\nto maintain electric neutrality. In a crowded electrolyte, this reconstitution changes physical and chemical properties of the solution. To explore these behaviors, a phenothiazine redoxmer fully miscible with\nacetonitrile was used, and electrochemical charge was mimicked by chemical oxidation. The solutions\nwere examined using small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and conductometry\nand modeled using classical molecular dynamics. Our study indicates that physical and structural properties of redoxmer solutions in both states of charge make it exceedingly difficult to increase the redoxmer concentrations over 2 M at any temperature without compromising dynamic properties of such\nsolutions. The cause for this limitation is proximity to a gel-like regime in which fluidity, diffusivity,\nand ionic conductivity exponentially decrease with increasing concentration. This tendency is compounded by non-Arrhenius behavior of the electrolyte: a small increase in the concentration outruns\ngains in fluidity and conductivity at a higher temperature.

Due to this compartmentalization, the battery can be scaled\nup, and there are suggestions to use such batteries to balance supply and demand in the electric grid. Given their scale, the grid-size\nRFBs need to have high energy density, low cost, exceptional electrochemical stability, and ease of recycling for all materials. Only\norganic active materials (redoxmers) and/or complexes of crust\nabundant elements are viable on this scale [1,6]. A particularly\nattractive option would be an all-organic RFB: as the electrochem-\n\n\f\n\nI.A. Shkrob, L.A. Robertson, Z.

In contrast, the neutral compound is nonplanar (Fig. 1a) and does not form stacks, which is a\ncontributing factor to miscibility. Solid salts containing MEEPT+d\nare exceptionally stable even in air, while solutions are sufficiently\nstable to allow for many types of measurements [8]. While\nMEEPT+dTFSI\u2013 is not miscible, it is one of the most soluble charged\nredoxmer salts known to date (see below). TFSI\u2013 is electrochemically inert and flexible anion that is used in ILs due to its ability\nto frustrate crystallization; [15,16] it serves the same purpose in\nRFB electrolytes.\nFor the cation, we chose Li+ for the following reasons. First, in\nhybrid RFBs, lithium metal serves as an anode, releasing the Li+\ncations during cycling. Second, there is a dearth of selective membranes for nonaqueous RFBs, and Li+ cation conducting membranes\nare possible candidates, especially at a higher temperature. Third,\nlithium-based electrolytes are currently the most studied group\nof nonaqueous electrolytes.\nIn solution, the Li+ cation strongly interacts with the ether\nchain of MEEPT (Fig. 1d). It is well known that glymes yield solvate ILs with lithium salts, with the Li+ cation chelated by two or\nmore ether oxygens [12,17]. We will show that MEEPT and\nLiTFSI also form a solvate IL. Below we examine ionic conductivity, diffusivity, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in neutral\nand chemically oxidized (charged) MEEPT solutions and use\nmolecular dynamics (MD) to interpret our observations.

At the very minimum, such solutions need to be flowable in all states of charge\nusing conventional pumps, which means that their kinematic viscosity (g) should be <10\u201320 cP. For efficient charge separation in\nthe stacks, the ions in the electrolyte need to conduct electricity\nwell; the ionic conductivity (r) of the solution should exceed 5\u2013\n10 mS/cm. To compete with aqueous RFBs, the molarity of redoxmers in these fluids needs to be at least 1.5\u20132.5 M and optimally\n2\u20134 M (assuming that all active molecules become charged during\ncycling) [6]. The redoxmers in such solutions need to be chemically\nstable in all states of charge and at all concentrations. The high\nmolarity implies high solubility of both neutral and charged states\nof the redoxmer molecule.\nTo illustrate what these requirements entail, consider a neutral\nmolecule (C) that serves a positive charge carrier (also known as a\ncatholyte) in a battery. [7]. In a charged state, this molecule\nbecomes a radical cation, C+d that pairs with an anion, Y\u2013 in electrolyte (X+Y\u2013). Depending on membrane selectivity, during charge,\nanion Y\u2013 can migrate across the membrane, cation X+ can migrate\nin the opposite direction, or (if the membrane is not ion selective)\nboth ions migrate in opposing directions. In this way, charge and\ndischarge can be thought of as converting a mixture of C and\nX+Y\u2013 to C+d Y\u2013 salt and vice versa. Because ionic conductivity decreases with electrolyte concentration for salt molarities >0.5\u2013\n1 M (due to increasing ionic association between X+ and Y\u2013) [7],\na limited amount of electrolyte can be introduced in order to minimize a loss of ionic conductivity and the concomitant increase in\nviscosity. In the following, we will consider the optimistic scenario,\nwhich is a quantitative conversion of 1:1 mol/mol C: X+Y\u2013 solution\nto C+d Y\u2013 solution: if the concentration of electrolyte is lower, some\ncatholyte molecules would not be charged, while if it is higher,\nionic conductivity and fluidity will suffer. As electrochemical\ncharging of concentrated solutions could be problematic even if\nthey have favorable dynamic properties, we used chemical conversion of C to C+d Y\u2013 to prepare such solutions [8].\nAs one increases the concentration, the solubility limit can\nbecome exceeded for one or more species, resulting in precipitation of C, X+Y\u2013, or C+d Y\u2013 from the solution. Currently, there are\nexamples of fully miscible redoxmers \u2013 at least in their uncharged\nstates, [9\u201311] and there are also numerous examples of miscible\neutectic and ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes [12]. Potentially there\ncould be miscible C+dY\u2013 salts, too, although at present such materials have not been demonstrated.

Ionic conductivity.\n\n1\n\nDirect current (d. c.) conductivity of solutions was measured\nusing forced-voltage BICON method [25,26] implemented with a\nCH Instruments Model 660D analyzer. In this method, two\n100 ls long pulses (5\u201350 mV, depending on resistance) of opposite\npolarity were applied sequentially, and the current was sampled\nevery microsecond; this bipolar pulse sequence was repeated\n200X to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The opposite pulses were\nused to remove capacitive contribution to impedance. The Ohmic\ncomponent was quantified, averaged, and calibrated against an\naqueous 10 mM KCl standard. A MI-905 platinum electrode from\nMicroelectrodes, Inc. was used in these measurements.\nThe liquid sample was placed in a glass container with a thermocouple microprobe positioned right above the microelectrode.\nA magnetic stirrer was used to homogenize the sample between\nconductivity measurements. A series of such measurements starts\nat the highest concentration, and the sample was incrementally\ndiluted with MeCN. The aliquots were taken and diluted with\nCDCl3 for 1H and 19F NMR analysis that gives concentrations of\nall components (see Figure S2). In some cases, the NMR solvent\ncontained 1,4-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene as an internal standard:\nthe signals of the protons in the solvent and the solute were referenced to the protons in the standard, and the same referencing was\nused for fluorine-19 nuclei in the TFSI\u2013 anions and the standard. In\nthis way all mole ratios could be determined (the same method\nwas used to verify concentrations in our SAXS experiments\ndescribed below). This yielded the chemical composition, and\nmolarities were computed knowing solution density.

The temperature was controlled\nby the spectrometer and was limited to 280\u2013345 K. Paramagnetic\nNMR line broadening makes it impossible to use this method for\ncharged redoxmers. Note that the diffusion coefficients are measured in CD3CN, which is slightly more viscous than MeCN. The diffusion coefficients for LiTFSI solutions obtained using this method\nwere reported in Refs. [31] and [7].\n2.5. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.\nNonpolarized OPLS-AA force field [32,33] in a LibParGen implementation [34,35] was used for the bond, angle, and torsion potentials in the redoxmers, while the density functional theory (DFT)\nwith the dispersive WB97XD functional [36] and aug-cc-pVDZ\nbasis set from Gaussian 16 [37] was used to optimize the molecular\ngeometries.\nThe partial atomic charges were calculated using CHELPG\nmethod [38,39] in a single-point Hartree-Fock calculation with\nthe DFT optimized geometry.

The high-q peak in the spectra corresponds to scattering of the X-rays of the solvent domains. The\nlower-q feature seen in concentrated solutions is the so-called correlation peak that indicates intermediate range spatial ordering of\nX-ray scattering centers. In this system, due to strong scattering of\nX-rays by the six fluorine atoms in TFSI\u2013 anion, this peak originates\nentirely from ordering of TFSI\u2013 anions. In our MD simulations,\nthese anions interact through their sulfonyl groups with multiple\nLi+ cations forming chains, and these chains organize themselves\ninto networks of associated ions (see the Discussion). At higher\nconcentrations, this ionic association becomes stronger and the\naggregates become increasingly ordered. This is observed as an\nincrease in the amplitude of the correlation peak (Figure S4a).\nThe increased ordering is also seen in a progressive shift of the correlation peak to higher q that signifies the decreasing scale of spatial ordering.\nThe increased ionic association is also revealed by ionic conductivity measurements shown in Fig. 3a. The ionic conductivity r\nincreases for LiTFSI concentrations c < 1 M and decreases at higher\nc as the ion mobility decreases while ionic association becomes\nstronger, reducing the effective concentration of charge carriers.\nIn Fig. 3b, we show changes in r from 20 to 65 \u00b0C for several LiTFSI\nconcentrations.

The ensemble averaged histogram of the maximum eigenvalues kmax for these matrices shows narrow peaks for the next neighbor molecules, but it\nbecomes increasingly smooth as the contact network emerges,\nwhich makes this histogram a convenient diagnostic of the solute\nnetwork emergence [45]. The contact statistics were calculated\nfor molecules with the interatomic distances smaller than the cutoff distance rcut of 2.8 \u00c5, which was estimated from the computed\ninteratomic radial pair distribution functions (RDFs).

This additional scattering is certainly from the TFSI\u2013\nanions. The similar transformations have been observed in other\nredoxmer containing electrolytes, see Refs. [43,44]. Two effects\nare at work here. First, in the presence of a solute, fewer solvent\nmolecules are available to screen ions, so the ionic association\nbecomes stronger, causing increased ordering of electrolyte ions\nand stronger correlation peaks (as seen for LiTFSI solutions).

These measurements gave rather different estimates from the ones reported here due to inherent ambiguity in\nusing the Arrhenius equation for systems that display nonArrhenius behaviors.\n3.2. Phenothiazine derivatives in acetonitrile.\nMEPT (see the inset in Fig. 2b) is a phenothiazine molecule that\nis closely related to MEEPT (Fig. 1a and 2c); it has the same aromatic head but a shorter ether chain. When the concentration of\nMEPT in MeCN increases over 1.5 M, a correlation peak is observed\nin the SAXS spectra of MEPT solutions, suggesting aggregation and\nordering of these molecules. The low-q spectrum is Lorentzian suggesting the classical Orenstein-Zernike behavior of density fluctuations [50\u201353].\nFor MEEPT (Fig. 2c), which has a longer oligoether chain, even at\n2.5 M there is no apparent correlation peak, indicating that the\nlonger chain frustrates molecular ordering. To further probe this\nordering, we used 3,7-dibromo derivative of MEEPT (DBrMEEPT),\nthe synthesis of which is described in ref. [54] Without the bromine atoms, the X-ray scattering contrast between MEEPT and\nthe solvent is relatively small, so one needs high concentrations\nof MEEPT to observe solute-related features. The bromine atoms\nin DBrMEEPT strongly scatted X-rays, and even dilute solutions\nyield solute signals (Figure S6). SAXS spectra for 0.20\u20130.65 M solutions of DBrMEEPT (which has low solubility in MeCN) do not exhibit correlation peaks.\nWe conclude that the longer ether chain in DBrMEEPT and\nMEEPT vs. the shorter chain in MEPT precludes ordering of the\nredoxmer, and this property may account for MEEPT\u2019s miscibility\n\n3.3.

These concentrations are comparable to\nsimilarly sized redoxmers. [7] Qualitatively, addition of a redoxmer\nincreases ionic association between Li+ and TFSI\u2013, in this way lowering ionic conductivity. At lower concentrations, ionic conductivity for charged and neutral MEEPT solutions is similar, but at\nhigher concentrations, it is greater for the charged MEEPT solution.\nAt 1.5 M, it is three times greater compared to the equivalent neutral solution. In the latter, ionic conductivity decreases from the\nmaximum of 25 mS/cm at 0.5 M to 6 mS/cm at 1.5 M, which is\nbarely acceptable in an RFB electrolyte. As ionic association is\nstronger for a smaller Li+ cation than for a larger MEEPT+d ion,\nthe ionic conductivity in charged MEEPT solution is higher.\nFig. 5b shows temperature dependence of ionic conductivity at\nthe maxima (Fig. 5a) and 1.5 M. These dependencies are almost linear. As seen in Fig. 3b, the same behavior was observed in LiTFSIMeCN solutions. As in these binary solutions, the activation energy\nfor solvent and ionic transport is low, which translates into weak\ntemperature dependence for ionic conductivity. To illustrate, at\n1.5 M, the ionic conductivity of the neutral MEEPT solution\nincreases from 5.7 mS/cm at 295 K to 12.9 mS/cm at 338 K, which\nbarely makes this solution acceptable as an electrolyte.\n\nmolarity is due to relatively great molecular weight of this radical\nion pair. The latter is difficult to avoid as the species need to be\nderivatized in order to become sufficiently flexible and odd shaped\nto prevent crystallization from solution. Consequently, in this system, concentrations >2 M are equivalent to having <70 mol% MeCN\nin solution. This is insufficient to fully solvate redoxmer molecules\nand ions, so solute\u2013solute interactions can become excessively\nstrong.\nWhen the experimental densities of charged and neutral MEEPT\nsolutions are plotted vs. their molarity at 300 K (Fig. 4a and 4b), the\ndata points are close to each other. In the same plot, we show calculated NPT ensemble densities over a wider range of concentrations.\nThe computed and experimental results are in good agreement, so\nwe extended these MD estimates to superconcentrated solutions\n(Fig. 4b). Also shown in Fig. 4a are 1:1:0 and 1:1:1 mol/mol/mol\nMEEPT/LiTFSI/MeCN compositions. These compositions are on the\nsame line; i.e., there is a continuous transformation from a dilute\nsolution towards a solvate IL as the MeCN is removed. This computed line misses the MEEPT+dTFSI\u2013 crystallographic density but\npasses through an amorphous state with the estimated density of\n1.496 g/cm3. We observed the same behavior in other redoxmer systems, [43,44] which suggests that such disordered states are closer\nstructurally to concentrated solutions than the corresponding crystals. The experimental maximum solubility of MEEPT+dTFSI\u2013 in\nMeCN is ~ 1.54 M at 298 K (the dashed vertical line in Fig. 4b).

While it is possible in this\nsystem to reach higher redoxmer concentrations without crystallization, this potential advantage is offset by rapid loss in mobility\nand ionic conductivity. Furthermore, as suggested by Fig. 5b,\nincreasing the temperature cannot significantly expand the concentration range of liquid-like behavior. Indeed, while r decreases\nwith the mole fraction of the solvent exponentially, it increases linearly with the temperature; thus, in the gel-like regime increasing\ntemperature is equivalent to a small increase in the concentration.\n\nthis system (mind the logarithmic scale for the diffusion coefficients). It is seen that both the experimental and estimated values\nfall on the same line; i.e., the solvent diffusivity (like r in Fig. 5c)\nexponentially decreases with the decreasing mole fraction of the\nsolvent.\nPlotted as a function of molarity, the data reveal two distinct\nregimes (the dashed lines in Fig. 6b).

[11], it was observed that the viscosity of MEEPT solutions increased almost linearly for MEEPT/electrolyte ratios < 1:1\nmol/mol (0.5 M electrolyte), whereas an increase in the MEEPT\nconcentration over 1\u20133 M caused rapid increase in the viscosity\nby the two orders of magnitude; the flow remained Newtonian\nfor all compositions studied. The charged solutions of the same\ncomposition were less viscous than the neutral ones, and in these\nsolutions, too, there was rapid increase in viscosity between 0.5 M\nand 1 M [11].\nPulse field gradient NMR provides a means for quantification of\nmolecular and ionic diffusion in liquids. For these measurements,\nCH3CN was replaced by CD3CN; the solvent contains sufficient\nCH3CN impurity to use it as a tracer to measure solvent selfdiffusion.\nFig. 6a shows the coefficient Ds for solvent self-diffusion plotted\nvs. the mole fraction of MeCN in solution.

We then consider how the models account for the properties\nof charged and neutral MEEPT solutions in different concentration\nand temperature regimes. With this knowledge, we use these models to show that changing electrolyte does not address challenges\nimposed by gel-like regimes. Finally, we demonstrate that in some\nsystems these limitations can be surpassed, albeit only at high\ntemperature and for small redoxmer molecules.\nAnother way to follow this discussion is to conceive it as a stepwise proof of the assertions made in the Introduction that there\nalways exists a well-defined upper limit to increasing the redoxmer concentration while maintaining acceptable dynamic\nproperties.\n\n3.3.4.

The same progression is observed for\nLiTFSI suggesting that the feature reflects the increasing association of TFSI\u2013 anions. We remind that without the salt, MEEPT does\nnot yield correlation peaks even at 2.5 M (Fig. 2c), so these features\noriginate through interaction of MEEPT and LiTFSI. All these behaviors are reproduced in our MD simulations shown in Figure S10.

Liquid acetonitrile\nAs suggested by results, the difficulty of raising the upper limit\nof redoxmer concentration by increasing temperature (without\nfalling into gel-like behavior) originates in the anomalous properties of the solvent, which makes it impossible to mitigate. The salient property of concern here is the low activation energy near the\nroom temperature. Here we show that our MD model accounts for\nthe non-Arrhenius behavior of the solvent in general and this low\nactivation energy in particular.\nA low activation energy (Ea < 10 kJ/mol) for diffusion in MeCN is\nnot exceptional: it is typical for aprotic fluids consisting of light\nmolecules (such as acetone, diethyl ether, and chloroform) but\nlower compared to most other polar solvents [55,56]. At 1 bar,\nMeCN melts at 227 K and boils at 355 K. In this temperature range,\nthe relaxation rate for a 14N nucleus follows the VFT equation with\nT 0 ~ 170 K [57]. Around 300 K, for diffusional reorientation, Ea\nis ~ 8.4 kJ/mol by Raman spectroscopy and ~7.8 kJ/mol by NMR\n[58\u201361]. For dynamic viscosity, Ea is ~ 7.5 kJ/mol (233 K to\n373 K) and for self-diffusion, Ea is 7.8 kJ/mol (Figures S11 and\nS12) [62,63]. Similar estimates for Ea were obtained using\nquasielastic neutron scattering [64]. For tracer diffusion, ferrocene\nand ferrocenium ion have Ea of 6.5 and 7.2 kJ/mol, respectively\n[65], and for Cl\u2013 ions, Ea is ~ 7.6 kJ/mol [66]. The closeness of Ea\nfor reorientation of solvent molecules and translational diffusion\nfor tracer molecules and ions indicates that for all species in solution the translational diffusion is rate limited by molecular reorientation of the solvent molecules [67].\nWhile there are numerous MD models for MeCN [61,67\u201372],\nmodeling of temperature-dependent dynamics is lacking in the lit-\n\n4.3. LiTFSI-MeCN solutions\nTurning to the LiTFSI-MeCN solutions (Fig. 8a and 8b), Figure S13 shows the diffusion coefficients for MeCN and LiTFSI ions\nplotted vs. salt molarity c. For c < 1.5 M the diffusion coefficients\nfor ions decrease linearly with c1/2; for c > 2 M the gel-like regime\nsets in, and there is rapid exponential decrease. In Fig. 8a, the computed Ds is plotted as a function of density for room temperature\nLiTFSI solutions. In addition to these points, the plot includes\n320\u2013360 K data for selected concentrations (color symbols).\nRemarkably, Ds appears to be largely a function of the density alone\n(as was recently observed for other nonaqueous electrolytes by\n9\n\n\f\n\nI.A.

[73] From the Arrhenius plots for computed Ds shown in\nFig. 8b, the activation energy for solvent transport increases\nfrom ~ 7.6 kJ/mol in dilute solution to ~ 16.5 kJ/mol in 4.2 M solution, and the onset of this increase corresponds to the onset of gelling, which is also seen in Fig. 3a. In this 4.2 M solution, at 300 K the\ndiffusion coefficient decreases by two orders of magnitude relative\nto neat solvent. The density plot of Ea shown in Fig. 8a resembles\nthe plot shown in Fig. 3a, suggesting that our MD model captures\nthe salient features of this binary system.\nUsing the same model, we estimated ionic conductivity r and\ndiffusion coefficients D for Li+ and TFSI\u2013 in 0.2\u20133.0 M LiTFSI solutions between 270 K and 420 K (not shown).

MEEPT+dTFSI\u2013 (charged) solutions.\nAs seen from SAXS data in Fig. 2c, MEEPT has a long, flexible\nchain that frustrates ordering of these molecules in solution. Poor\nordering is further assisted by nonplanarity of aromatic head\ngroups (Fig. 1a). This advantage does not extend to MEEPT+d,\nwhich has a planar radical cation (Fig. 1b). In MEEPT+dY\u2013 crystals,\nthe radical ions form isolated pairs (TFSI\u2013 and SbCl\u20136) or infinite\nchains (BF\u20134, ClO\u20134, and PF\u20136) with the planes of aromatic rings separated by 3.24\u20133.52 \u00c5 (Fig. 1a). The Coulomb repulsion of positively\ncharged radical cations in these p -stacks is reduced by electrostatic attraction to nearby anions. This compensation is stronger\nfor smaller, rounder anions like BF\u20134, and weaker for odd-shaped,\nflexible anions like TFSI\u2013. The stronger the ionic association, the\ngreater this compensation, assisting ordering of the radical ion\npairs into a crystal.\nTo characterize this stacking in solution, we adapted metrics\nintroduced in ref.", "start_char_idx": 45048, "end_char_idx": 48475, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08af3401-5144-4441-b1eb-5ff4c2cfa687": {"__data__": {"id_": "08af3401-5144-4441-b1eb-5ff4c2cfa687", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6fbfe2a-4996-4c04-9b52-b486423e981f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c630c7d068631f97ed25f276471659e7bc198f7d94ba7f0c17aa8162f693fe5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9edd3472-c00a-445d-bcc4-40a7d3ba8b54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f03795d4b4574477488e33448832c3b96b27c1aa101cb66fa657526ee14fa6e"}, "3": {"node_id": "73da544c-0ef7-4f01-8c2d-964f9f5f31b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2209f36d5aa92876306cd6d3888845eca454fcb8b9f6d345359f1918ec2949c"}}, "hash": "13c5cd88baee9c2d1dbd6131a8a2a58ab453cf22f56ba1446d8087e69aafa96f", "text": "characterize this stacking in solution, we adapted metrics\nintroduced in ref.

The weak correlation in the positions of TFSI\u2013\nanions seen in SAXS spectra is due to weak association with (large)\nradical cations.\n\n(which is required to simulate conductivity and SAXS data), so we\ncalculated the stack fraction for this MD model. As seen from\nFig. 4b, in this model, too, there is MEEPT+d stacking at ~ 1.5 M.\nLowering of the charge on MEEPT+d decreases Coulomb repulsion,\nbut it also decreases association with TFSI\u2013 anion, and the two\neffects cancel each other.\nIt follows from our MD calculations that most MEEPT+d radical\ncations do not form stacks in solution; rather they make random\ncontacts with each other. Assuming the contact radius of 2.8 \u00c5,\nwe calculated the neighboring statistics for MEEPT moieties in\nthe charged and neutral MEEPT solutions (Figure S20). According\nto these calculations, the average number of MEEPT+d and TFSI\u2013\nions around each MEEPT+d radical cation linearly increases with\nmolarity, eventually reaching six in MEEPT+d TFSI\u2013. Over the same\nconcentration range, the number of MeCN molecules in the solvation shell of MEEPT+d decreases from twelve to none. At the solubility limit, there are six MeCN molecules and three MEEPT+dTFSI\u2013\npairs around each radical cation, which is sufficient for a 3dimensional network of the associated MEEPT+d TFSI\u2013 pairs to\narise.\n\n4.6.

Figure S27a shows\nMEEPT and ionic diffusivities plotted vs. Ds in the neutral MEEPT\nsolution in a manner of Figure S8. Comparison with the latter figure indicates that the model reproduces the trends observed in\nthe 300 K solutions. It also suggests that such trends would extend\nto a higher temperature of 360 K. While we do not have diffusion\ndata for charged MEEPT solutions, Figure S27b suggests that in\nthese solutions, too, the TFSI\u2013 anion moves faster than MEEPT+d\nat low concentrations, and the diffusion coefficients become comparable at higher concentrations.\nFigure S28 shows computed temperature dependences for the\ncoefficient Ds of self-diffusion for MeCN compared to experimental\ndata shown in Figure S9. The MD simulation yields almost linear\nincrease in Ds with the temperature (reproducing the experimentally observed trend). Increasing temperature increases mobility\nin both states of charge; however, the general shape of the concentration dependencies remains the same (Figure S29). At 360 K, the\ncharged system would be liquid-like for all concentrations < 2 M,\nwhile the neutral system still would be gel-like at 2 M. To obtain\nthe same Ds as observed for 1.5 M at 300 K, the equivalent MEEPT\nconcentration would be 1.86 M at 360 K, so the gain in concentration is only 25% (Figure S29).

MEEPT:LiTFSI (1:1 mol/mol) system\nThere are relatively small differences between neighborhood\nstatistics for neutral and charged MEEPT solutions (Figure S20),\nexcept for fewer TFSI\u2013 anions associated with MEEPT as opposed\nto MEEPT+d. Figure S21a shows computed SAXS spectra for 1.5 M\nsolution (see an MD snapshot in Figure S22) separated into linearized contributions from different species in solution (see ref.\n[44] for technical details of such spectral decompositions). Most\nof the signal that contributes to the correlation peak arises from\nTFSI\u2013 anions; however, had the correlation peak been exclusively\nfrom these anions, it would be at 0.65 \u00c5\u00011. The head groups of\nMEEPT contain X-ray scattering high-Z sulfur atoms, so MEEPT:\nLi+ complexes yield a correlation peak ~ 1.05 \u00c5\u00011, and the observed\ncorrelation peak partakes of both ionic species. The lithium atom\ndoes not scatter X-rays strongly, so its contribution to SAXS is negligible. In Figure S21b we exaggerate this contribution to illustrate\nthat Li+ and MEEPT have the same correlation peak due to their 1:1\ncomplexation. We remind the reader that the MEEPT:Li+ cation\ncomplex and TFSI\u2013 anion is associated through the chelated Li+\n(Fig. 1d and S22). In Section S3 and Figures S23 to S26 therein\nwe show that such MEEPT:Li+ complexes form a contiguous network at concentrations as low as 1\u20131.5 M. As the complexes aggregate, so do the associated TFSI\u2013 anions, and this ordering is\nobserved in SAXS.\nFor charged MEEPT solutions, the mode of TFSI\u2013 ordering is simple electrostatics. At 1.5 M, the stacking of MEEPT+d cations is inefficient, and their packing is loose (as there are no Li+ cations to fix\n\n4.7. Is the Li+ cation special?\nGiven the MEEPT:Li+ complexation, it is pertinent to ask\nwhether our observations generalize to cations that do not form\nsuch ion\u2013solute complexes. To this end, we computationally\nreplaced Li+ with organic cations (X+): tetramethylammonium\n(NMe+4) and N-propyl-N-pyrrolidinium (P+13). The latter is a flexible\ncation that is a popular choice for IL-based electrolytes (see, e.g.,\nrefs. [74,75]).\nTable 1 shows computational results for 1:1 mol/mol MEEPT/X+\nTFSI\u2013. When the compositions of the same mole fraction are compared (we chose 14 mol%, which corresponds to 1.5 M for MEEPT/\nLiTFSI), replacing the Li+ cation with an organic cation considerably\nincreases cation and MEEPT mobility and (to a smaller degree)\nanion mobility. In this sense, excluding cation binding by MEEPT\ndoes improve mobility. However, replacing the Li+ cation with a\nbulkier cation reduces density and hence molarity of these solutions. To obtain solutions of the same molarity (in this case,\n\nTable 1\nMD calculated diffusion coefficients (D) for species in 1:1 mol/mol solutions of MEEPT and X+TFSI- in acetonitrile (MeCN), where X+ is the Li+ cation, tetramethylammonium\n(NMe+4) and N-propyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium (P+13), at 300 and 360 K.\nX+\n\n+\n\nLi .\n\nNMe+4\n\nP+13\n\nT,", "start_char_idx": 52021, "end_char_idx": 55076, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72f1c6dc-0346-4d82-9bc3-722b69cf95d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "72f1c6dc-0346-4d82-9bc3-722b69cf95d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6fbfe2a-4996-4c04-9b52-b486423e981f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c630c7d068631f97ed25f276471659e7bc198f7d94ba7f0c17aa8162f693fe5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "73da544c-0ef7-4f01-8c2d-964f9f5f31b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2209f36d5aa92876306cd6d3888845eca454fcb8b9f6d345359f1918ec2949c"}, "3": {"node_id": "05e6b064-4c87-4b42-8074-e16f26fe7cea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "d8548d73e0d913a2c9d3774243ad972b4c766a7aeab1160d949ca6a7df1b19aa"}}, "hash": "036ac2044e225bee915835e4d5e0d48df52c1a3113d45a31d7949c7334bb327d", "text": ".\n\nNMe+4\n\nP+13\n\nT, K\n\n300\n360\n360\n300\n300\n360\n360\n300\n300\n360\n360\n\nMEEPT,.mol%\n\n14.00\n13.97\n15.19\n14.00\n18.26\n18.26\n20.84\n14.00\n21.91\n21.91\n27.16\n\nD, x10-6 cm2/s\n\nMEEPT,.M\n\n1.5\n1.44\n1.5\n1.33\n1.50\n1.41\n1.50\n1.23\n1.50\n1.42\n1.50\n11\n\nMeCN\n\nsolute\n\nX+\n\nTFSI-\n\n3.73\n11.45\n11.40\n4.78\n2.94\n12.26\n9.46\n5.67\n1.38\n9.05\n6.67\n\n0.26\n1.41\n1.15\n0.49\n0.32\n1.75\n1.65\n0.71\n0.14\n1.22\n1.16\n\n0.86\n2.79\n2.60\n1.82\n0.79\n4.74\n2.79\n1.86\n0.39\n2.67\n1.77\n\n1.32\n4.07\n4.00\n1.58\n0.71\n3.71\n2.75\n1.35\n0.31\n2.63\n1.93\n\n\f\n\nI.A.

Can 2 M be exceeded?\n\n1.5 M), the solute mole fraction needs to be increased from 14 mol%\nfor Li+ to 18.3 mol% for NMe+4 to 21.9 mol% for P+13. This increase\n(given the proximity to gel-like region) negates the advantage of\ncation replacement (Table 1), causing considerable decrease in\ndiffusivity.\nLike in the MEEPT/LiTFSI solutions (see above), a temperature\nincrease does not improve this situation as it causes volume\nexpansion that further decreases molarity. To maintain the redoxmer molarity of 1.5 M at 300 K (that would define the power density) one needs to increase the mole fraction of this redoxmer still\nmore to compensate for this volume expansion. For LiTFSI, this\nincrease is modest (15.2 mol% vs. 14 mol%), for organic cations it\nis 20.8 mol% for NMe+4 and 27.2 mol% for P+13 (which almost doubles\nthe mole fraction compared with the initial 14 mol%). Increasing\nthe mole fraction of electrolyte causes net decrease in the mobility,\nso using hot solutions of the same molarity (1.5 M) shows no\nimprovement in dynamic properties.\nThe root problem are large molar volumes for the solute. At\n300 K, in 1:1 mol/mol MEEPT/X+TFSI\u2013 (no solvent) the concentration of MEEPT would be 2.03 M for NMe4TFSI and 1.85 M in P13TFSI\ncompared to 2.48 M for LiTFSI.

That is, large molar volume of\nMEEPT leaves little room for reaching 2 M without incursion into\nthe gel-like regime.

The practical significance of this\nfinding is unclear, as chemical stability of charged redoxmers\nwould suffer in hot solutions, while maintaining high temperature\ndiverts electric power. Nevertheless, this approach appears to be\nthe only path to reaching concentrations of 2\u20134 M assumed in\ntechnoeconomic analyses that underlie nonaqueous RFB development. [6]\n\n5. Conclusion\nIn the Introduction, we asked what factors other than solubility\nwould limit redoxmer molarity in nonaqueous RFB electrolytes.\nWe purposely disregarded all properties other than fluidity and\nionic conductivity. These additional requirements will only further\ndecrease the limits we have established. Most of our experimental\nwork was on a phenothiazine system, yet our conclusions are\ngeneral.\nPresently, improving solubility of redox-active molecules in\nnonaqueous RFB electrolytes draws the most attention, and it\nmay appear that this solubility is the main obstacle to achieving\na higher energy density. Our study suggests otherwise: gelling of\nconcentrated solutions and freezing of dynamics effectively limits\nthe maximum redoxmer concentration in systems that avoid crystallization; in fact, this gelling is precisely how the crystallization is\navoided. Above a certain well-defined concentration, which for\nmost redoxmers is between 1 and 2 M, fluidity, conductivity, and\ndiffusivity of electrolyte decrease exponentially with increasing\nconcentration, so even a slight increase in this concentration\nmakes the solution excessively viscous and electrically resistive.\nThis gelling occurs in either state of charge and at all temperatures.\nThe critical concentration for gelling is somewhat higher for a\ncharged redoxmer, but, as favorable dynamic properties need to\nextend to all states of charge, this does not lower the concentration\nlimit.\nStill it may appear that increasing the solution temperature can\nimprove these concentration limits by increasing molecular and\nionic mobility and redoxmer solubility. Unfortunately, low thermal\nactivation energies for molecular and ion transport preclude significant improvement in this fashion. The dynamic properties (such as\nviscosity and conductivity) increase slowly with the increasing\ntemperature, whereas they change very rapidly with the increasing\nredoxmer concentration.

Here, we develop machine learning models of\nsolvation energies to replace expensive quantum chemistry calculations with\ninexpensive-to-compute message-passing neural network models that require only\nthe molecular graph as inputs. Our models are trained on a new database of solvation\nenergies for 130,258 molecules taken from the QM9 dataset computed in \ufb01ve\nsolvents (acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, and water) via an implicit\nsolvent model. Our best model achieves a mean absolute error of 0.5 kcal/mol for molecules with nine or fewer non-hydrogen atoms\nand 1 kcal/mol for molecules with between 10 and 14 non-hydrogen atoms. We make the entire dataset of 651,290 computed\nentries openly available and provide simple web and programmatic interfaces to enable others to run our solvation energy model on\nnew molecules. This model calculates the solvation energies for molecules using only the SMILES string and also provides an\nestimate of whether each molecule is within the domain of applicability of our model. We envision that the dataset and models will\nprovide the functionality needed for the rapid screening of large chemical spaces to discover improved molecules for many\napplications.\n\n\u25a0\n\nincluding convolutional neural networks9,10 and \ufb01ngerprintbased ML.11,12 Similar experimental databases, like those from\nthe University of Minnesota,13 provide solvation data for many\nsolvents and have also been used as the basis for ML models,\nas illustrated by pioneering work from Borhani et al.14 and\nSubramanian et al.15 The limited size and chemical diversity of\nexperimental data (only a few hundred molecules) make them\nimpractical to use with high-accuracy, deep learning models\n(e.g., refs 16\u221218). This issue can be addressed by developing\nlarge and diverse datasets of solvation properties (>100,000\nmolecules) via computations that provide su\ufb03cient representation of di\ufb00erent regions of the chemical space.\nHere, we report on a new large dataset, QM9-solvation, of\ncomputed solvation energies (\u0394Gsolv) for 130,258 molecules in\nmultiple solvents and provide an initial set of ML models\ntrained using this data.

The solvents chosen for the DFT\ncalculations are acetone, ethanol, acetonitrile (ACN), dimethyl\nsulfoxide, and water. The energies of these molecules in the gas\nphase [Egas] and in the solvent [Esolvent] were used to calculate\nthe solvation energy [\u0394Gsol] of the molecules in each of the\nsolvents via the following equation.\n[\u0394Gsol ] = [Esolvent ] \u2212 [Egas]\n\n(1)\n\nThe computed solvation energies of all molecules from QM9\nand selected molecules from the Pedley compilation,28\nreported in kcal/mol, are available on the Materials Data\nFacility.20\nMachine Learning.

We denote these\nmolecules our \u201cPedley test set.\u201d They were not selected\nrandomly but drawn from a set of molecules for which\nsolvation energies have been measured experimentally (unlike\nthose in the QM9 training set, which were generated\nprocedurally) and, further, were chosen to exhibit qualities\ndesirable for validation (e.g., possessing molecular motifs not\nincluded in the QM9-solvation dataset).\nThe full dataset, which we denote QM9-solvation, is\navailable through GitHub and the Materials Data Facility.20,21\nPredicting Solvation Energies of Molecules in Water\nSolvent: MPNNs. Our goal is to link the graph structure of a\nmolecule to solvation energy. Using only the molecular graph\nmeans that estimating the solvation energy of a molecule does\nnot require any force \ufb01eld or quantum chemistry computations, which both allows our models to screen new chemicals at\nhigh rates and mitigates concerns about tying predicted\nsolvation energy to a speci\ufb01c conformation.\nThe use of ML to link molecular structures to properties is\nwell studied.7 We choose to evaluate two techniques from the\nliterature due to their simplicity: group contribution with linear\nregression and MPNNs. Both methods start by labeling atoms\nin the molecule with type information, such as by element or\nby functional group, but di\ufb00er signi\ufb01cantly in how these labels\nare mapped to functional properties.\nWe modeled our group contribution approach on the widely\nused model for water\u2212octanol partition coe\ufb03cient (log P) of\nWildman and Crippen.38 We de\ufb01ne functional groups for each\nnon-hydrogen atom in a molecule by \ufb01rst assigning a type\nbased on the element of that atom, whether it is in an aromatic\ncycle, and its degree. We then complete the description of the\natom by computing the types of the neighboring atoms using\nthe same procedure and recording the type of bonding. Our\nprocedure lacks the hand-tuned groups of Wildman and\nCrippen but distinguishes atomic sites more fully. For example,\nour method describes primary and secondary aliphatic carbons\ndi\ufb00erently; these are treated as identical by Wildman and\nCrippen. We believe that this further granularity is needed for a\ndataset as diverse as QM9. We represent each molecule as a\nvector in which each entry corresponds to the count of that\nfunctional group type. We then use L1 regularized linear\nregression using the least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator (LASSO)39 to \ufb01t a linear model between this vector\nand solvation energy.\nOur second type of model is a message-passing neural\nnetwork, which provides an automatic path for learning the\nsimilarity between di\ufb00erent functional groups and their impact\non a material property. An MPNN, as formalized by Gilmer et\nal.17 and described in the Methods section, learns interactions\nbetween atoms/functional groups through \u201cmessage-passing\u201d\nsteps that update the description of each atom based on the\ntypes of neighboring atoms and the types of bonds connecting\nto the neighboring atoms.

We base our training set on the QM9 database of\nRamakrishnan et al.24, which has been used frequently in the\nmolecular ML community for a number of reasons. First, the\ndatabase is large: with over 105 entries, QM9 provides\nsu\ufb03cient training data to support the development of many\nML models.29,31,32 Second, the database is diverse. QM9 is\nbased on an exhaustive sampling of molecules,5,33 which allows\nus to train and validate our molecules with a minimal concern\nover whether it is learning patterns related to the sampling of\ndata rather than the physics of the problem.\nWe used the SMD implicit solvation model in Gaussian to\ncompute the solvation energy for 130,258 molecules from\nQM9. We selected SMD for its comparable accuracy to explicit\nsolvent models and reasonable correlation with experimental\nsolvation energies at a reduced computational cost.34,35 For\neach molecule, we computed the solvation energy in \ufb01ve\nsolvents that sample a broad range of dielectric constants:\nacetone (\u03f5 = 20.49), ethanol (\u03f5 = 24.85), acetonitrile (ACN)\n(\u03f5 = 35.69), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (\u03f5 = 46.83), and\nwater (\u03f5 = 78.36). We selected these solvents to not only\ncapture di\ufb00erences among the solvation behavior of di\ufb00erent\nmolecules but also selecting solvents of technological relevance\n(e.g., ACN and water are common solvents for \ufb02ow\nbatteries36).\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, the solvation energies for our\nmolecules follow, generally, a single-modal distribution. The\n\nFigure 2.

The standard deviation in the\nsolvation energy is approximately 2.8 kcal/mol for all solvents\nexcept water, which shows a wider distribution with a standard\ndeviation of 4.3 kcal/mol. Some molecules have solvation\nenergies substantially higher or lower than most in the dataset.\nThe solvation energies for these molecules can range from as\nlow as \u221284 kcal/mol to as high as 5 kcal/mol. For example,\nthere are 543 (0.4%) and 428 (0.3%) molecules with solvation\nenergies below \u221220 kcal/mol in water and acetone,\nrespectively.\nWe divide the QM9 molecules into a \ufb01rst subset of 117,232\nmolecules, used for model training, and a second subset of\n13,026 molecules, used for model evaluation.

The relatively poor\npredictive performance on these materials is partly explained\nby the solvation energy being outliers compared to the rest of\nthe data. Twelve of the top 25 (48%) errors belong to a class of\nmolecules, zwitterions, that is rare, with only 396 (0.3%)\nentries within the training data. We conclude that the model\u2019s\npredictions are most reliable for molecules with solvation\nenergies of less negative than \u221225 kcal/mol and are, for\nexample, inaccurate for zwitterions.\nExtending an MPNN Solvation Model to Other\nSolvents. We next enhanced our MPNN model to predict\nsolvation energies in other solvents. We explored two di\ufb00erent\nstrategies for creating \u201cmulti-task\u201d models able to predict\nsolvation energy in di\ufb00erent solvents simultaneously. The \ufb01rst\napproach is a standard multi-task model in which the last layer\nof the neural network produces multiple outputs, one per\nsolvent. The second approach involves a network that predicts\nsolvation energy given the molecular structure of the solute\nand the dielectric constant of the solvent. This \u201cdielectric\nconstant\u201d model, unlike the multi-task model, can predict\nsolvation energy in solvents not included in the training set.\nHere, we test which method produces more accurate models\nand how well the dielectric constant model computes solvation\nenergy for solvents outside of the training set.\nWe evaluate our two strategies by training a model with the\nsame 90/10% test split as our single-solvent model and data\nfrom all the \ufb01ve solvents. The multi-task and dielectricconstant models have comparable accuracy to the singlesolvent model in predicting solvation energy in water. The\nsingle-solvent model has an error of 0.44 kcal/mol for solvation\nenergy in water\ue0d5e\ufb00ectively equal to the errors of 0.43 and\n0.45 kcal/mol for the multi-task and dielectric constant\nmodels, respectively. We note that we previously observed\nthat training a multi-task model with greatly varied properties\n(e.g., highest occupied molecular orbital energy and atomization energy) can lead to a signi\ufb01cant degradation in model\naccuracy.37 It appears that the solvation energies of a molecule\nin di\ufb00erent solvents are su\ufb03ciently similar such that modeling\ndi\ufb00erent solvents simultaneously in the same model does not\nlead to degradation in performance.\nWe further explored the concept of multi-solvent prediction\nby withholding data from one of our \ufb01ve solvents, ACN, to use\nas a test set. We selected ACN for this test case because it has\nthe median dielectric constant of the \ufb01ve solvents and thus\nshould be a good test for our ML model\u2019s ability to interpolate.\n\ndescribes atoms initially based on their type, degree, number of\nbonded hydrogen atoms, and whether it is in an aromatic ring;\nupdates the atom description with messages based on sums of\nthose from its nearby atoms; and generates a description of the\nentire molecule as a sum of all atoms. Full details are available\nin the Methods section.\nWe compared the MPNN and linear regression models for\npredicting the solvation energy in water using the training and\ntest datasets described in the previous section. As shown in\nFigure 3, our MPNN model has a mean absolute error (MAE)\n\nFigure 3.

Comparison of di\ufb00erent domains of applicability metrics: Tanimoto similarity to the 64 most similar molecules in the training set,\ndistance based on the atomic and molecular \ufb01ngerprints from an MPNN model for solvation energy, and variance in a bootstrap ensemble of 16\nmodels. The performance of each metric was assessed using 13,217 molecules from our holdout set using ACN as a solvent. (a) MAE and\nnormalized applicability metric for molecules divided into 16 bins grouped by each metric. The metrics are normalized by applying a linear\ntransformation such that the 1st and 99th percentiles have values of 0 and 1, respectively. (b) Likelihood of an error greater than 1 kcal/mol for 16\nbins of molecules grouped by each metric. The dotted lines between data points are intended to guide the eye. The black dashed lines show the (a)\nMAE on the entire holdout set and (b) fraction of errors >1 kcal/mol for the holdout set.\n\npoor performance. Such behavior suggests for us to consider\nmetrics that measure similarity in functional groups between\nmolecules to estimate the performance of our model.\nOur metrics are based on common approaches from the\nchemoinformatics community,42 such as distances from the\ntraining set and variance of an ensemble of ML models. We\nexplore three di\ufb00erent applicability metrics. We \ufb01rst chose the\nTanimoto similarity based on Morgan Fingerprints,43 which\nrepresents a molecular similarity metric that is not tuned for\nany particular property. We also chose two applicability metrics\nbased on our MPNN models. The \ufb01rst is based on the\nmolecular \ufb01ngerprint MPNN model, where we compute the\nmean L2 distance between the molecular \ufb01ngerprint (see\nFigure 1) for a molecule and those of the 64 closest molecules\nfrom the training set. The second is based on the \ufb01ngerprints\nfor each atom as computed using the atomic contribution\nmodel, where we compute the dissimilarity of a molecule from\none in the training set as the mean distance between the most\nsimilar pairs of atoms\n\ngreatest amount of training data. There could be a few\nexplanations for the relationship between error and molecule\nsize. Namely, there could be an e\ufb00ect of bias in the training set\ndue to the overrepresentation of data with nine heavy atoms or\na failure in the assumption that the atom count and solvation\nenergy should be linearly related. We therefore propose reweighting techniques to account for training set bias or\ndi\ufb00erent approaches for summing atomic contributions (e.g.,\ngeneralized means) as a direction for modeling non-linear\nrelationships between atomic size and property.\nThe \ufb01nal ingredient of the utility of our model is the speed\nat which we can evaluate new molecules. Evaluating the model\nrequires parsing the SMILES string to an RDKit molecule\nobject, converting the RDKit molecule to a graph representation compatible with TensorFlow and evaluating the MPNN.\nThe conversion steps can be performed in parallel for each\nmolecule and the individual mathematical operations of the\nMPNN can also be parallelized, allowing us to exploit highly\nparallel CPUs and general purpose GPUs.

Accordingly, we can\nachieve an evaluation rate of 103 molecules per second on two\n32-core Intel Xeon CPU E5-2683 v4 CPUs.

The extreme evaluation rates noted here can be\nfurther improved by running the models on multiple nodes of a\nsupercomputer, making it possible to rapidly screen molecule\nspaces with billions of candidates.\nQuantifying Domain of Applicability. The empirical\nnature of ML models makes it di\ufb03cult to identify which\npredictions are most or least likely to be accurate. In the\nprevious section, we established that molecular size correlates\nwith error\ue0d5a likely e\ufb00ect of the training set being biased\ntoward molecules with nine non-hydrogen atoms. Here, we\nexplore improved metrics for establishing a quantitative\nestimate of the size of the error for a prediction.\nOur previous analysis of the performance of the models on\npredicting solvation energies in water give clues on what is\nimportant in estimating the performance of the model. We\nnoted, in particular, that zwitterions were overrepresented in\nthe molecules with the largest error (48% of largest errors were\nzwitterions compared to only 0.4% in the test set). The poor\nperformance of the models on a class of molecules that are\nstructurally distinct from most of the training set is re\ufb02ective\non how the MPNN models implicitly learn the behavior of\nfunctional groups within molecules.

We note that a(m, n) is not a\nproper distance metric, as a(m, n) \u2260 a(n, m). As with the\n\u201cmolecular \ufb01ngerprint distance\u201d, we compute the atomic\n\ufb01ngerprint distance as the average distance over the 64 closest\nmolecules. In all cases, we assume that larger distances or lower\nsimilarities from the training set indicate greater likelihood that\na molecule is outside of the training set.\nOur \ufb01nal applicability metric is based on the variance of the\npredictions of an ensemble of MPNNs. We created an\nensemble by training 16 atomic contribution MPNNs each\nwith a di\ufb00erent, randomly selected subset created by randomly\nsampling the full training set with replacement (i.e., a\nbootstrapped ensemble). The variance of this training captures\nthe uncertainty of individual predictions.44,45 We assume that\nmolecules with larger uncertainties are more likely to have\nlarger errors.\nWe evaluated the quality of our domain of applicability\nmetrics by measuring the correlation between each application\nmetric for each prediction and the size of the observed error.\n5995\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.1c01960\nJ.

Users of\nthe model can de\ufb01ne their own cuto\ufb00 for a domain of\napplicability depending on how much uncertainty that can\ntolerate. We can also use the uncertainties of the models to\nfurther improve them47 or accelerate the discovery of\nmolecules with target properties.48,49\n\n\u25a0\n\nDetailed description of the message-passing neural\nnetwork architecture (PDF)\n\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\n\nCorresponding Author\n\nLogan Ward \u2212 Data Science and Learning Division, Argonne\nNational Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States;\norcid.org/0000-0002-1323-5939; Email: lward@anl.gov\nAuthors\n\nNaveen Dandu \u2212 Materials Science Division, Argonne\nNational Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States;\norcid.org/0000-0001-7122-8537\nBen Blaiszik \u2212 Data Science and Learning Division, Argonne\nNational Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States;\nGlobus, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637,\nUnited States\nBadri Narayanan \u2212 Materials Science Division, Argonne\nNational Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois 60439, United States;\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, University of\nLouisville, Louisville, Kentucky 40292, United States\nRajeev S.

Understanding chemical interactions that stabilize crucial\nreaction intermediates of CO2 is important, and in this contribution, we\nemploy atom centered density matrix propagation (ADMP) molecular\ndynamics simulations to investigate interactions between CO2\u2212 anion radicals\nwith surrounding solvent molecules and electrolyte cations in both aqueous\nand nonaqueous environments. We show how di\ufb00erent cations and solvents\na\ufb00ect the stability of the CO2\u2212 anion radical by examining its angle and\ndistance to a coordinating cation in molecular dynamics simulations. We\nidentify that the strength of CO2\u2212 interactions can be tailored through\nchoosing an appropriate cation and solvent combination. We anticipate that\nthis fundamental understanding of cation/solvent interactions can facilitate the optimization of a chemical pathway that results from\nselective stabilization of a crucial reaction intermediate.\n\n\u25a0\n\nINTRODUCTION\nTransforming CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels is of\ngreat interest to create a sustainable carbon neutral cycle to\ntackle challenges such as climate change.1\u22123 However,\nreducing CO2 is a challenging process due to its thermodynamic stability, poor electron a\ufb03nity, and large kinetic\noverpotentials. Additionally, as a nonpolar gas, it is only\nsparingly soluble in water (0.033 M),4 a common solvent for\nelectrochemical reduction of CO2.1 Therefore, it might be\nadvantageous to use nonaqueous (aprotic) solvents due to the\nhigher CO2 solubility, enhanced potential window, as well as\nlower proton concentrations that can suppress the undesired\nhydrogen evolution reaction.5\u22127\nThe \ufb01rst step of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR)\ninvolves the formation of CO2\u2212, and although successful\nstudies have been performed to unravel the mechanism of\nelectrochemical CO2RR,8\u221217 molecular-level understanding of\nthe dynamics of CO2\u2212 interacting with surrounding electrolyte\ncations and solvents (aqueous vs nonaqueous) remains\nunclear. Of particular interest is the cation e\ufb00ect,18\u221224 which\nwas \ufb01rst introduced by Murata and Hori, and it has been better\nunderstood that coupling alkali metal cations (M+) with CO2\u2212\ncocatalyzes the \ufb01rst step25,26 in aqueous solvents, i.e., * + CO2\n+ M+ + e\u2212 \u2192 M+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7*CO2\u2212 by a short-range electrostatic\ninteraction. In nonaqueous solvents, however, alkali metals are\nknown to inhibit CO2 reduction due to the formation of a\npassivation layer containing carbonate species.27,28 Therefore,\nelectrolyte cations such as NX4+ (X = methyl, ethyl, and butyl\n\u00a9 2022 Chicago Argonne, LLC, Operator\nof Argonne National Laboratory.\nPublished by American Chemical\nSociety\n\ngroups) are being used, and their catalytic roles were\nexamined.24,29 In", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3432, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea79a8e1-93ae-4cd1-aa00-34bd8e942372": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea79a8e1-93ae-4cd1-aa00-34bd8e942372", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3ecdc5f9-abad-4272-83b7-63ddd7f107d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "941a461a6e1abb9c82f387b5b22df3fd9f32f7753331b431db5bababdf761218"}, "2": {"node_id": "b1c27450-e1c5-44db-aa04-0095ef396656", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c2fad6d910d66a8e0e86ec4df3ee29ef1f0114d741e92877e74687d9f04cfd98"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8ece009-731a-4a5c-8d2e-db673f0daf51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c3a4c716102c97f60b6d3c390c136c0a09e3abc46d200af81443796d59180907"}}, "hash": "74a7fe39d62fcf3baf1132daf6c14ec8e0459bada74d72c6f5a8a0788fc0e3a9", "text": "being used, and their catalytic roles were\nexamined.24,29 In aprotic Li\u2212CO2 batteries, it was argued\nthat a LiCO2 intermediate is crucial to tuning CO2RR toward a\nsolution- versus surface-mediated pathway.30\nIn this contribution, we aim to provide theoretical insights\ninto the fundamental interactions between CO2\u2212, obtained\nfrom the electrochemical reduction of CO2 gas, and the\nsupporting electrolyte cations in various solvents, which will\nhelp direct the mechanism toward desired products such as\nCO, formic acid, and/or oxalate, and will lay a foundation to\nthe future study of speci\ufb01c catalyst systems.

We use the atom\ncentered density matrix propagation (ADMP)40\u221242 molecular\ndynamics method, as it gives the accuracy of density functional\ntheory (DFT) and has advantages particularly around handling\nthe dynamics of charged and radical molecular systems.43\u221247\nThis approach allows us to gather accurate information on how\nthe CO2\u2212 anion radical interacts with cation and solvent\nspecies, based on the computed descriptors such as\ncoordination bond distances (cation\u2212CO2) and bond angles\nto develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions.\nThe shorter coordination distance and/or more decreased\nbond angle of CO2\u2212 indicate that the intermediate complex\ncan be present for prolonged periods and likely undergo\nsubsequent desired reactions such as chelation, charge transfer\ninteractions, and bond cleavage/formation reactions.48,49 We\nfurther construct a physics-based model to rationalize the\nrelative contributions of electrostatic and covalent/noncovalent interactions to the stabilization e\ufb00ects of CO2\u2212.\n\n\u25a0\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\nInitial geometry optimizations were performed using Gaussian\n16 software50 at the \u03c9b97xD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory51,52\nwith ultra\ufb01ne integration grids and multiple conformers\nconsidered.53 The frequencies were calculated at the same\nlevel of theory.

Note that the equations for the complexation\nenthalpy calculations are provided in the Supporting\nInformation. In the case of the DME solvent system, the\nchelation of the DME molecule with the alkali metal cation\nincreases the interaction distance for alkali metal cations with\n\nthe CO2\u2212, while for NX4+ cations (X = Me, Et, and Bu), the\ndi\ufb00erence is minimal (<0.1 \u00c5). This is largely due to the\nchemical di\ufb00erences between water and DME molecules.\nWater molecules are strongly polar and have strong ion-dipole\n18132\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c01733\nACS Omega 2022, 7, 18131\u221218138\n\n\f\n\nACS Omega\n\nhttp://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf\n\neach simulation three times with di\ufb00erent initial geometries\n(randomly generated and subsequently optimized) to make\nsure that the selection of initial structures have no role in\ndictating the \ufb01nal results.

However,\nthe strength of the interaction between CO2\u2212 and NBu4+ is\na\ufb00ected by how strongly CO2\u2212 is coordinated to the solvent\nand cationic species. Thus, increasing the polarity of the\nsolvent increases CO2\u2212 coordination with the solvent,\nweakening the bond between CO2\u2212 and NBu4+. Similar\nqualitative trends in CO2RR were also reported by Berto et\nal.59 and Shi et al.,60 where voltammetric experiments in the\npresence of NBu4+ electrolytes have shown larger current\ndensity values for CO2RR in highly polar DMF and MeCN, as\ncompared to low polarity THF. Here, DMSO has the largest\nstandard deviation (Figure 3), which was also found to exhibit\nthe largest deviation from trends due to coordination via the\nsulfur atom (as opposed to via the oxygen atom in water and\nTHF) in a study of aprotic solvent (THF, DMF, and DMSO)\nadsorption on metal surfaces by N\u00f8rskov and co-workers.61 In\naprotic solvents and NBu4+ salts, tailoring the lifetime of the\nCO2\u2212 will likely depend on solvent, due to the stabilizing\nin\ufb02uence of more polar solvents.\nThe foregoing analysis suggests that both solvents and\ncations play an important role in the stabilization of the CO2\u2212\nradical,59,60 but the precise e\ufb00ects are less clear. On the basis of\nour simulations, we hypothesize that inner-sphere solvation\ne\ufb00ects are the result of electrostatic and covalent/noncovalent\ninteractions based around solvent stabilization and cation\nbinding, and to this end, we sought to rationalize these by\nconstructing a simple physics-based model. Compared to gasphase CO2\u2212, the introduction of a solvent molecule or a cation\nreduces the angle of CO2\u2212. In Figure 4a, the largest reductions\nare observed with cations without solvent molecules, following\nthe trend of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > NX4+ in the gas phase (gray\nbars), where X = methyl or longer alkyl groups.

On the basis of the computed enthalpies of complexation (Table 1), the CO2\u2212 species itself weakly interacts with\nDME as compared to water (by 0.50 eV) because DME\nmolecules do not have any strong localized partial positive\ncharges. The NBu4+ positive charge is highly shielded by the\nbutyl arms and as such does not closely interact with the DME\noxygen atoms, which also can be seen from our quantum\nchemical calculations that the di\ufb00erence between \u0394Hcomplex\nand \u0394Hgas for the NBu4+ complex is much smaller than that for\nalkali metal cations (Table 1). The optimized structures of\nNBu4+ complexes are shown in Figure S1. The optimized\nstructures of Li+\u2212CO2\u2212\u2212solvent with DME and H2O also\ncorroborate the above analysis; i.e., the oxygen atoms of CO2\u2212\nonly bind to Li+ in the DME solvent, as shown in Figure 2a,\nwhereas in water one of the CO2\u2212 oxygen atoms binds to Li+,\nand the other interacts with water to form an O\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H hydrogen\nbond as shown in Figure 2b. Overall, this suggests that the\nidentity of the supporting electrolyte cation, as well as the\npolarity of solvents, both dictate the strength of interactions of\nthe CO2\u2212 anion radical, which primarily consist of (electrostatic) ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions and hydrogen\nbonds. The di\ufb00erent types of interactions will be discussed\nin more detail.\nTo further explore how the NX4+\u2212CO2\u2212 interaction\nresponds to the polarity of the solvent, we carried out\nADMP simulations with three explicit solvent molecules (in\nTHF, MeCN, DMSO, DMF, and water) and at the same time\nincluded the implicit solvent \ufb01eld of corresponding solvent\nmodels in Gaussian 16.

Error bars represent standard deviations of three simulations.\n\ncomplex stability is associated with a decreased CO2\u2212 angle.\nThis decreased angle is due to anion radical stabilization\nthrough ion-ion interactions, ion-dipole interactions, and/or\nhydrogen bonds. Given the computed trends of solvent\npolarity and complexation enthalpy simultaneously (Figure 3\nand Figure 4b) and together with known experiment data, we\nwould be able to provide guidance on the electrolyte\nenvironments, e.g., with larger stabilizing e\ufb00ects on CO2\u221263\ntoward the desired binding.\nTo decompose the quantum chemistry-calculated complexation enthalpies into stabilization e\ufb00ects by electrostatic ionion interactions and/or ion-dipole interactions explicitly, we\nhave constructed a simple physics-based model (see Supporting Information).

Simulations show the e\ufb00ect of cations and solvent\nmolecules on the fundamental properties of bond distance and\nangle of CO2, e.g., DME solvation increases the interaction\ndistance for small cations with CO2\u2212, while for NX4+ cations\nthe di\ufb00erence is minimal. This correlates well with the\ncomplexation enthalpy of CO2\u2212, o\ufb00ering a guide to which\ncombinations of solvent and supporting electrolyte may\nprovide the desired experimental conditions. Moreover, we\nhave shown that the identity of the supporting electrolyte\ncation will likely matter more in polar solvents than in solvents\nof less polarity. Therefore, we can tailor the strength of\ninteractions between CO2\u2212 and supporting electrolytes\nthrough the judicious choice of electrolyte cations and\nsolvents. Our simulation and physics-based model provides a\ngeneral and suitable approach to studying solvation e\ufb00ects\nparticularly in an aprotic electrolyte environment, and it was\nshown that the electrochemical CO2RR activity could be\ncorrelated to the bulk solvation properties in DME and\nDMSO.27 We note the limitation of our model not yet\nincluding the electrode surface as well as the pH e\ufb00ect at the\n\nTable 2.

However, rational design\nof polymers is challenging due to the variety of aspects that in\ufb02uence their properties and performance.1 For example, the\nmonomer(s) structure, synthesis method and processing control\nthe chemical structure, morphology and hence properties of the\n\ufb01nal polymer.2 Additionally, researchers are increasingly considering sustainability of monomer sourcing, interactions between a\npolymer and its environment, polymer aging behavior and end of\nlife (whether as waste, or recyclable).3,4 These relationships are\nschematically shown in Fig. 1. These considerations \u2013 and more \u2013\nmean any given monomer leads to a variety of properties, and\ndesired properties may be accessed through a variety of monomers. For example, low-density polyethylene and high-density\npolyethylene have the same monomer but very different mechanical properties, and polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl\nchloride are all used to make similar plastic bottles. As a result, traditional research methods using trial and error based on chemical\nintuition are often insuf\ufb01cient to fully design solutions to polymer\ninnovation and discovery.5 Data-driven and informatics-based\napproaches are needed to move the \ufb01eld forward faster.6\nRecent advances in", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3701, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35241981-5633-4db0-8d04-bc5bc1652f3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "35241981-5633-4db0-8d04-bc5bc1652f3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "933ce475-2abd-4782-ac1b-2e6fda0e94f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "497f8c3a031432fe4ba543fe6c909a85f0561353d83b4d6cd4216a84c86b221c"}, "2": {"node_id": "068027ab-58b7-4b18-9bbb-94d5942780cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "fd829f26d64ee5e4ca7412df43cb39a643574ed1bf66fc0975d9cdf853477de6"}, "3": {"node_id": "d4e66d25-31ea-4064-aca3-b2c9fcbbc27f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "05f27ca3c00d11354d32bf66ea65cd2a9a9a300bd4f8667bc4628a9a4fc215c8"}}, "hash": "6a3e7fc951263aa0c1d9496c57ed59ccf81b93d34617e837ae2831d98663d67b", "text": "are needed to move the \ufb01eld forward faster.6\nRecent advances in drug development and the successes of the\nMaterials Genome Initiative7\u201310 are examples illustrating the bene\ufb01ts of an informatics-based approach.11 Data-driven research\ncan dramatically accelerate discovery, and lead to improved performance.12 Understanding which structures lead to speci\ufb01c\nproperties (informatics) offers insights about underlying\nstructure\u2013function relationships.13 Data-driven approaches also\nallow inverse design, where a desired property (or properties) is\nidenti\ufb01ed, and data are used to determine what structure(s) corresponds to that property.9,14 Done properly, data-driven research\nallows researchers to move beyond their own intuition, experience and biases to discover connections that were previously\nunimagined.\n\nPolymer informatics is a relatively new \ufb01eld, but one with rapidly\ngrowing importance.

Often, the best way to understand a dataset is through machine learning (ML) (i.e. regression\nand classi\ufb01cation). To do this ML, we need accurate representations, so the polymer representation and featurization section\nfocuses on popular approaches of developing ML input.

ML is particularly sensitive to data quality,\nas it is very sensitive to artifacts,41\u201343 and is poor at extrapolation.44 Therefore, it is important to identify and account for any\nbiases in a dataset, and gather large datasets.45 Despite a wide\narray of available materials databases, it is often challenging\nto \ufb01nd a complete dataset relevant to a speci\ufb01c research\nquestion.

The number of highquality materials databases is growing, but most databases only\nhave hundreds or thousands of entries, representing a much\nsmaller chemical space than the small-molecule databases. Additionally, initiatives to expand and create materials databases10,51\nare divided between inorganic materials and soft materials. For\npolymers, databases of interest are PolyInfo,52 the extension of\nPolyInfo PI1M,53 and the Khazana54 databases. We note that to\naccelerate polymer informatics the community needs a validated\n\nwileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/pi\n\nMM Cencer, JS Moore, RS Assary\nand curated database and repository where researchers can\ndeposit new polymer data, similar to the Cambridge Structural\nDatabase,55 but containing property data as well as characterization data. An additional source of polymer data is handbooks.\nPolymer data handbooks have a broad array of data, and while\nmost would require some effort to make the data accessible to a\ncomputer,56,57 some are fully accessible online.58\nThe imprecision of polymer naming conventions is a hurdle to\nwidespread polymer data sharing. Traditionally, polymer names\nindicate what repeat units are incorporated, and, if relevant, the\nrelationship between comonomers (e.g. random or block) and\ntacticity. However, given the stochastic nature of polymers more\nprecise information on structure is omitted. If a database of polymer information is going to be useful to a researcher who did not\ngenerate it, the new researcher must be able to understand the\nprecise identity and nature of the entries in the database. This is\nespecially important if multiple sources of data are being combined to develop a suf\ufb01ciently large database for a speci\ufb01c problem. The polymer informatics community needs to settle on a\nstandard method of detailing polymer structures and data. One\napproach to developing a standard schema for polymer data sharing is PolyDat.59 PolyDat is designed to include all relevant data\nfor a polymer, including characterization data, synthesis procedures and information on all relevant species and post-functionalization. An overview of the PolyDat schema is shown in Fig. 2(a).\nThere are three key parts of the PolyDat schema: preamble, species and transformations. The preamble contains all the metadata,\nreaction network information and data provenance. It gives all the\ninformation needed to understand the other sections. The species\nsection contains all the characterization data on all the species in\nthe reaction network. This characterization data can be of any\ntype. The transformations section includes information on all the\nreactions (both synthesis and any post-synthetic modi\ufb01cations),\nincluding the reaction procedures. Use of a standard data schema\nwill greatly increase the ability of researchers to extract published\nresults.\n\nPOLYMER REPRESENTATION AND\nFEATURIZATION\nAn accurate ML model requires inputs (features) that describe the\nsystem of interest. An accurate useful model depends on properly\nchosen and designed features.60,61 Features are a wide range of\nitems, from properties of atoms (e.g. partial charge, atomic number)\nin the molecule of interest, to calculated electronic properties\n(HOMO, LUMO, etc.), to measured experimental values (e.g. glass\ntransition temperature, heat capacity), to reaction or processing conditions24,62 (temperature, pH, etc.). The critical requirement for a feature set is that it accurately and uniquely describes each data point in\na machine-readable format. Often, the lengthiest stage in a ML project is identifying which features are needed, which are super\ufb02uous\nand what is the best method to generate those features.\nSome ML models for the prediction of polymer properties may\nachieve high accuracy solely using features based on monomers.63\nMonomer-based features range in", "start_char_idx": 7341, "end_char_idx": 11363, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15f6440c-f4ca-4367-9379-ed07deafafe4": {"__data__": {"id_": "15f6440c-f4ca-4367-9379-ed07deafafe4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "933ce475-2abd-4782-ac1b-2e6fda0e94f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "497f8c3a031432fe4ba543fe6c909a85f0561353d83b4d6cd4216a84c86b221c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4e66d25-31ea-4064-aca3-b2c9fcbbc27f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "05f27ca3c00d11354d32bf66ea65cd2a9a9a300bd4f8667bc4628a9a4fc215c8"}, "3": {"node_id": "28f5f828-8977-4680-b15b-de4633468e26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "6f709dbe2b11a911a77a4bd2dbf85f237034aa496d0b0e0612ce2b275286062e"}}, "hash": "129d1b7439ee1cd963ec4dd829fac3863cd7ab2f8c264eec7a6ca3aa819db72a", "text": "solely using features based on monomers.63\nMonomer-based features range in complexity from constitutional\ndescriptors (number of rings, number of heavy atoms, etc.), to\ntwo-dimensional representations (atomic connectivity, topological\ndescriptors, molecular graphs, etc.), to three-dimensional geometric descriptors (computationally generated or crystallography\nbased), to four-dimensional conformational ensemble descriptors.64 Two common approaches for developing monomer-based\nfeatures are \ufb01ngerprinting62,64,65 and graph-based methods.\n\n\u00a9 2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry.\n\nPolym Int 2022; 71: 537\u2013542\n\n10970126, 2022, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pi.6345 by Argonne National Laboratory, Wiley Online Library on [11/01/2023].

Ideally, all models of this\ntype would be shared in a format that makes them useable to\nresearchers without having to recreate the training process.

We have shown in previous work that machine learning\nmodels trained on high-level quantum-chemical calculations (G4MP2) for organic\nmolecules with one to nine non-hydrogen atoms can provide accurate predictions for\nother molecules of comparable size at much lower costs. Here we demonstrate that such\nmodels can also be used to e\ufb00ectively predict energies of molecules larger than those in\nthe training set. To implement this strategy, we \ufb01rst established a set of 191 molecules\nwith 10\u221214 non-hydrogen atoms having reliable experimental enthalpies of formation.\nWe then assessed the accuracy of computed G4MP2 enthalpies of formation for these 191 molecules. The error in the G4MP2\nresults was somewhat larger than that for smaller molecules, and the reason for this increase is discussed. Two density functional\nmethods, B3LYP and \u03c9B97X-D, were also used on this set of molecules, with \u03c9B97X-D found to perform better than B3LYP at\npredicting energies. The G4MP2 energies for the 191 molecules were then predicted using these two functionals with two machine\nlearning methods, the FCHL-\u0394 and SchNet-\u0394 models, with the learning done on calculated energies of the one to nine nonhydrogen atom molecules. The better-performing model, FCHL-\u0394, gave atomization energies of the 191 organic molecules with\n10\u221214 non-hydrogen atoms within 0.4 kcal/mol of their G4MP2 energies. Thus, this work demonstrates that quantum-chemically\ninformed machine learning can be used to successfully predict the energies of large organic molecules whose size is beyond that in\nthe training set.\n\n\u25a0\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPredicting accurate energies is essential for determining\nreaction energetics and enthalpies and stabilities of molecules\nin general. Knowledge of precise thermochemical data,\nparticularly of organic molecules, is desired in areas such as\nbattery electrolytes, catalysis, drugs, etc. Speci\ufb01cally, for\nbatteries there is an urgent need to develop organic electrolytes\nwith improved electrochemical performance and longer-term\nstability.1 However, screening of the electrolytes used in\nbatteries is challenging because there is a large pool of organic\nmolecules2 that are of potential interest. Synthesizing and\ntesting each individual molecule would be extremely\nchallenging even with combinatorial high-throughput screening3 and is not practical.

The second part of this work\ninvolved an evaluation of the performance of previously\nreported ML models for prediction of molecular energies. Two\nML methods were used: kernel-based ridge regression\n(FCHL)38 and a continuous \ufb01lter convolutional neural\nnetwork (SchNet),39 both combined with \u0394 learning on the\ndi\ufb00erence between the DFT and G4MP2 energies.

The assessments of the\nML methods were done on a holdout set of the dataset, i.e., a\nset of molecules not used in the training of the method. The\nquantum-chemical methods used for the ML were the G4MP2\ncomposite method5 and the B3LYP density functional\nmethod.33\u221235 In this work, we used the two best-performing\nML methods found in that work.36 In addition, in this study we\nassessed the suitability of the \u03c9B97X-D density functional\nmethod for learning.

The\nG4MP2 method is a composite one that replaces the fourthorder perturbation methods in G4 theory6 with reduced\nperturbation theory levels to lower the computational cost.\nOther parts of the G4MP2 method remain the same as in G4\ntheory. It has been assessed on the G3/05 test set of accurate\nexperimental data,18 on which it has a mean absolute deviation\nof 0.77 kcal/mol for the 138 hydrocarbons and substituted\nhydrocarbons in the test set.\nThis investigation is based on a dataset of large molecules\nwith 10 to 14 non-hydrogen atoms (C, N, O, and F). They\nwere chosen from the molecules with 10 to 14 non-hydrogen\natoms in the Pedley compilation of experimental gas-phase\nenthalpy of formation data for organic molecules.22 Two\ncriteria were used in choosing the molecules. First, they had to\nhave a stated experimental uncertainty of \u00b11 kcal/mol in the\ncompilation, which was the case for 225 molecules. The\nG4MP2 enthalpies of formation at 298 K (\u0394fH\u00b0(298 K)) were\ncalculated for this set of molecules in a similar manner as in\nprevious work,41,42 where enthalpies of formation at 0 K\n(\u0394fH\u00b0(0 K)) were calculated by taking the di\ufb00erence between\nthe known enthalpies of formation of the corresponding atoms\nand the calculated atomization energies.

On the\nbasis of the second criterion, 34 molecules were dropped,\nresulting in a dataset of 191 molecules, which is called the\nPDS(10-14) dataset throughout this paper. The resulting\ndataset had 71 hydrocarbons and 120 substituted hydrocarbons. The 34 molecules that were dropped because it was\nlikely that they had large experimental errors are listed in Table\nS1.

The failure of G4MP2 for aromatics has not been\nnoted before as far as we are aware, probably because of the\nsmaller sizes and numbers in previous studies.

For the six aromatics with 14\nnon-hydrogen atoms in this set of 54 aromatics, the MAD for\nG4MP2 is 3.63 kcal/mol, compared with 1.65 kcal/mol for G4\ntheory.

That work applied ML on molecules\nwith nine or fewer non-hydrogen atoms (training set of\n117 232 entries) and then tested on a holdout set (13 026\nentries). The two best ML models, SchNet-\u0394 and FCHL-\u0394,\nhave di\ufb00erent accuracy/speed trade-o\ufb00s and enabled the\ne\ufb03cient prediction of G4MP2-level energies with an accuracy\nof up to 0.1 kcal/mol for the holdout set. These models were\nbased on energies from the B3LYP functional of the holdout\nset and the G4MP2 and B3LYP energies of the GDB-9 training\nset. Furthermore, the trained FCHL-\u0394 and SchNet-\u0394 methods\nwere assessed on 66 sugar molecules with more than nine nonhydrogen atoms but without accurate experimental values. The\npredictions of G4MP2-level energies for the 66 molecules had\nMADs of 0.29 and 0.91 kcal/mol for the two methods,\nrespectively.\nIn this work, we determined how the two best models,\nSchNet-\u0394 and FCHL-\u0394, performed on the 191 larger\nmolecules in the PDS(10-14) dataset when trained on the\nG4MP2 and DFT energies of the set of smaller molecules,\nGDB-9. In the \u0394-learning results presented here, we have also\nused the better-performing functional \u03c9B97X-D in addition to\nB3LYP. We used a training set of 13 026 molecules chosen\nrandomly from the GDB-9 set of 130 258 molecules. We used\npreviously computed G4MP2 and B3LYP energies19 for this\ntraining set as well as \u03c9B97X-D energies computed in this\nwork. These energies were then used to perform \u0394 learning.\nWe randomly selected 10% (i.e., 1303 molecules) as a holdout\nset to test the performance of the two ML methods as well as\nthe two DFT methods. The methods were then assessed on\nthe PDS(10-14) molecules.\nTable 4 summarizes the ML results for the holdout set of\n1303 molecules from the GDB-9 dataset and the 191\nmolecules in the PDS(10-14) dataset.

This result\nis expected on the basis of the improved performance of\n\u03c9B97X-D compared with B3LYP. The SchNet-\u0394 MADs for\nthe holdout set of 1303 molecules were 0.40 and 0.31 kcal/mol\nfor B3LYP and \u03c9B97X-D, respectively, compared with 1.71\nand 0.94 kcal/mol for the PDS(10-14) set. The poorer\nperformance of SchNet-\u0394 relative to FCHL-\u0394 is similar to\nwhat we found previously for smaller molecules.36 Finally, we\nnote that when the B3LYP-based FCHL-\u0394 method from the\ntraining set (117232) was used, the MAD was only slightly\nsmaller (0.39 kcal/mol).\nOverall, the FCHL-\u0394 model based on \u03c9B97X-D energies\nperformed the best for the PDS(10-14) molecules, which are\nlarger molecules than used in the training set (one to nine nonhydrogen atoms). As FCHL-\u0394 is based on the kernel ridge\nregression model, it requires comparison of each test entry to\nall available training entries when predicting a molecular\nproperty. Thus, its computational cost per prediction is at least\n100 times greater than that of SchNet-\u0394 but orders of\nmagnitude faster than that of G4MP2. Hence, we recommend\nthe use of FCHL-\u0394 for its greater accuracy. Both codes are\navailable at DLHub.48 Despite the smaller number of\nmolecules used for training of the larger molecules, the results\nin Table 4 and illustrated in Figure 4 show that the SchNet-\u0394\nand FCHL-\u0394 methods have larger errors relative to G4MP2 as\nthe size of the molecule increases, although the accuracy for\nFCHL-\u0394 of better than 0.4 kcal/mol is still good.

However, it has been found to have signi\ufb01cantly increased\nerrors when applied to larger organic molecules with 10 or more nonhydrogen atoms.\nWe report here on an investigation of the cause of the failure of G4MP2 theory for such\nlarger molecules. One source of error is found to be the \u201chigher-level correction\n(HLC)\u201d, which is meant to correct for de\ufb01ciencies in correlation contributions to the\ncalculated energies. This is because the HLC assumes that the contribution is independent of the element and the type of bonding\ninvolved, both of which become more important with larger molecules. We address this problem by adding an atom-speci\ufb01c\ncorrection, dependent on atom type but not bond type, to the higher-level correction. We \ufb01nd that a G4MP2 method that\nincorporates this modi\ufb01cation of the higher-level correction, referred to as G4MP2A, becomes as accurate as G4 theory (for\ncomputing enthalpies of formation) for a test set of molecules with less than 10 nonhydrogen atoms as well as a set with 10\u221214 such\natoms, the set of molecules considered here, with a much lower computational cost. The G4MP2A method is also found to\nsigni\ufb01cantly improve ionization potentials and electron a\ufb03nities. Finally, we implemented the G4MP2A energies in a machine\nlearning method to predict molecular energies.\n\n\u25a0\n\nMinnesota scaling methods of Truhlar and co-workers.9\nThere have also been variations of G4MP2 theory, such as\nG4MP2-6X and G4MP2-XK, that have been meant to address\ncertain types of problems and to extend to other\nelements.10\u221212\nIn recent work, we have reported on investigations of\nquantum chemically informed machine learning for the\nprediction of G4MP2 energies of organic molecules. In one\npaper, we used quantum chemical energies of a set of 130,258\nmolecules with 1\u22129 nonhydrogen atoms13 to train and assess\nthe performance of several machine learning (ML) methods.14\nTwo ML methods were used: a kernel-based ridge regression\n(FCHL)15 and a continuous \ufb01lter convolutional neural\nnetwork (SchNet),16 both combined with \u0394-learning on the\ndi\ufb00erence between the G4MP2 energies and B3LYP energies.\nThe best-performing ML method was able to predict G4MP2\nenergies to within 0.1 kcal/mol.14 In a subsequent paper,17 we\nexamined how the two best-performing ML methods from the\n\ufb01rst paper performed on molecules larger than the test set of\n1\u22129 nonhydrogen atoms.

It has an accuracy of 0.83 kcal/mol (mean absolute\ndeviation) for the 454 systems in the G3/05 test set. G4 theory\nuses a combination of single-point energies [CCSD(T)/631G(d), MP4/6-31+G(d), MP4/6-31G(2df,p), MP2(FU)/\nG3LargeXP, and HF limit] at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)\ngeometry and an empirical higher-level correction (HLC) to\nachieve this accuracy. A major limitation of G4 theory is the\nlarge increase in computational resources required as the\nmolecules become larger, due to the MP4 calculations. To\nlower computational costs, the G4MP2 method was developed\nin which the fourth-order perturbation components of G4\ntheory3 are replaced with reduced perturbation theory levels.\nG4MP2 is approximately 6\u22128 times faster than G4.3 While this\nincrease in speed comes with some loss of accuracy, with the\nmean absolute deviation for the G3/05 test set increasing to\n1.03 kcal/mol, G4MP2 has been widely used.\nG4 theory is one of a number of accurate quantum chemical\nmethods that have been developed for predicting molecular\nenergies to better than 1 kcal/mol accuracy.

To have accurate enthalpies of formation\nfor molecules with 10 to 14 nonhydrogen atoms, we derived\naccurate experimental data for a set of 191 molecules. The\nbetter-performing ML method investigated in the second\npaper, FCHL-\u0394, gave atomization energies for these 191\norganic molecules within about 0.4 kcal/mol of accurate\nquantum chemical energies calculated by the G4MP2 method.\nAlthough this level of accuracy is less than that obtained with\nFCHL-\u0394 for a hold-out set of the smaller molecules (0.1 kcal/\nmol), it demonstrated that quantum chemically informed ML\ncan be used to successfully predict energies of large organic\nmolecules with sizes beyond those in the training set at a much\nlower cost in computer time.\nAnother result in ref 17 was that analysis of G4MP2\nenthalpies of formation of the 191 molecules with 10\u221214\nnonhydrogen atoms revealed that the G4MP2 method is\nsigni\ufb01cantly less accurate for these larger molecules than it is\nfor the set of smaller organic molecules with 1\u22129 nonhydrogen\natoms. Compared to accurate experimental data, the G4MP2\nmethod had a mean absolute deviation of 1.41 kcal/mol for the\nmolecules with 10\u221214 nonhydrogen atoms, which was\ndramatically larger than the 0.79 kcal/mol for 459 organic\nmolecules having 1\u22129 nonhydrogen atoms.

From an analysis\nof the molecules having large errors in the set of 191\nmolecules, it was found that G4MP2 does especially poorly for\nlarge aromatic molecules and for molecules with multiple\nnitrogen atoms. In addition, G4 theory was investigated for a\nsubset of 54 aromatic molecules of the 10\u221214 nonhydrogen set\nand was found to do considerably better (mean absolute\ndeviation of 1.15 kcal/mol compared to 1.84 kcal/mol for the\nsame set with G4MP2).\nThe objectives of the work reported in this paper were to\ndetermine the cause of the failure of the G4MP2 theory for the\nlarger molecules identi\ufb01ed in ref 17 and to investigate remedies\nfor the problem. One source of error investigated was the\nhigher-level correction, which is meant to correct for\nde\ufb01ciencies in correlation contributions to the molecular\nenergies. One problem for this approximation is that it assumes\nthat the contribution is independent of the element and the\ntype of bonding involved. This approximation seems to be a\nproblem that becomes worse in larger molecules, which may\nhave types of molecules not present in the sets of smaller\nmolecules on which G4MP2 performs well. To address this\nproblem, we have added an atom-speci\ufb01c correction to the\nHLC. Importantly, this correction is dependent only on the\ntype of atom, not on the bond type, as the latter would make\nimplementation di\ufb03cult. With this simple addition to the\nHLC, we \ufb01nd that the G4MP2 method, referred to as\nG4MP2A, becomes as accurate as G4 theory, with a much\nsmaller cost. We also added this type of modi\ufb01cation to the G4\nmethod, referred to as G4A, but found little improvement. The\nG4MP2A method is also found to do better than G4MP2 for\nionization potentials and electron a\ufb03nities. The G4MP2A\nmethod has been implemented in the ML learning method\npreviously reported for G4MP2. This implementation\nimproves the ML-predicted energies considerably because\nthey are now trained on data with G4-like rather than G4MP2\naccuracy.\nIn the Methods section, we describe the theoretical methods\nand test sets used in this paper. In the Results and Discussion\nsection, we report on how the new parameterization performs\nfor enthalpies, ionization potentials, and electron a\ufb03nities, as\n\nArticle\n\nwell as an analysis of the results. In this section, we also\ndescribe the new ML results for the G4MP2A method.\nConclusions are drawn in the Conclusions section.\n\n\u25a0\n\nMETHODS\nThe energies of the molecules and ions considered in this work\nwere calculated using the composite G4MP2 method.3 Some\nresults for the G4 method1 are included for comparison, and a\nsimilar procedure is used. In the G4MP2 method, a higherlevel correction (HLC) is added on to the series of calculations\nto account for remaining de\ufb01ciencies in the energies. The HLC\nhas six parameters. The HLC includes corrections for the\nnumber of pairs of electrons in closed-shell molecules (or\nions), the number of pairs of electrons and unpaired electrons\nin open-shell molecules (or ions), and the number of pairs of\nelectrons and unpaired electrons in atoms and atomic ions.\nThere is also a correction for the energy of a pair of electrons\nin molecular and atomic nonhydrogen species having only one\npair of valence electrons.\nIn the current work, we have added an \u201catom-speci\ufb01c\ncorrection\u201d, i.e., a correction that is speci\ufb01c to the number of\neach type of atom in the molecule or ion, that increases or\ndecreases the atomic energies to minimize the mean absolute\ndeviation with respect to experiment for the test sets as\ndescribed below.

The atom-speci\ufb01c correction is similar to a\nmethod proposed by Perdew et al.18 for improving several\ndensity functional methods.

The dramatic improvement in the G4MP2A\nenergies compared to G4MP2 for molecules with 10\u221214\nnonhydrogen atoms is illustrated in Figure 1. When the\ncomparison is made on a per electron pair basis as a function of\nnonhydrogen atoms in Figure 2, G4MP2A also shows a\nsigni\ufb01cant improvement over G4MP2 for the molecule set with\n10\u221214 nonhydrogen atoms. In addition, we have performed\ncomputations with G4 theory for a limited set of the larger\nmolecules in the 185 PDS(10\u221214) set, to enable comparison\nwith G4MP2A. This set includes the 54 aromatic molecules in\nthe PDS(10\u221214) set. The results in Table 2 show that for\nG4MP2, the error is reduced from 1.93 to 1.07 kcal/mol for\nthis set of molecules, which is actually better than the G4 result\n(1.16 kcal/mol). We note that the set of data used to optimize\nthe atomic correction parameters did not include the\n\nthe molecules still performed poorly. We identi\ufb01ed one\npossible cause of this to be that the structure that we used\nin the previous study was not the lowest-energy conformer.\nDue to the large number of potential conformers of the larger\nmolecules in this test set, locating the lowest-energy conformer\nis more di\ufb03cult using traditional geometry optimization\ntechniques. As a result, we used an advanced sampling\ntechnique to search for other more stable conformers of\nthese molecules based on G4MP2 energies. For this purpose,\nwe used the CREST (Conformer\u2212Rotamer Ensemble\nSampling Tool) utility program28 to perform conformational\nsearches on the previously published PDS(10\u221214) set of\ngeometries as a starting point.17 When performing these\nconformational searches, referred to as Method-1, we\noptimized the resultant conformers using the GFN2-xTB\nmethod29,30 and then selected the lowest-energy conformer for\ncarrying out a new G4MP2 energy calculation. Although it\nprovided lower-energy conformers for some of the molecules,\nwe still had cases where some previously published17\nconformers were more stable than those found by the\nCREST program. Thus, we also performed CREST starting\nfrom SMILES strings, referred to as Method-2. However, even\nthis method did not always provide the lowest-energy\nconformers. Overall, we updated our previously published\nPDS(10\u221214) set of molecules containing 191 species with new\ngeometries when Method-1 or Method-2 gave the lowest\nenergies based on comparing G4MP2 energies. With this\nimproved set of geometries, we then eliminated six molecules\nout of 191, based on isodesmic reactions performed on the\nresultant geometries. The isodesmic evaluation was done\nsimilarly to our previous study.25 The new geometries of the\n185 are given in an Excel spreadsheet in the Supplemental\nInformation.\nTable 2 shows the mean absolute deviations (MADs) of the\nstandard enthalpies of formation at 298 K for the 185\n4531\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c01327\nJ.

We found that the MAD for\nthe enthalpies of formation for the 87 aromatic molecules in\nthe PDS(10\u221214) set is 1.92 kcal/mol. In contrast, the MAD\nfor the remaining 98 (nonaromatic) molecules is 0.99 kcal/mol\n(almost one-half compared to the MAD of aromatic\nmolecules). The signed error per carbon atom increases from\n1.08 kcal/mol for 6 carbon atoms to 3.04 kcal/mol for 14\ncarbon atoms in the aromatic molecules in PDS(10\u221214). The\nresults for all 87 molecules as a function of the number of\ncarbon atoms in the molecule are shown in Figure 3, and the\nresults are in Table 4. The results show a signi\ufb01cant increase in\nerrors on G4MP2 energies with an increase in the number of\ncarbon atoms for the 87 of PDS(10\u221214) aromatic molecules.\nHowever, there is no such e\ufb00ect in the case of the G4MP2A\nenthalpies. Thus, it is apparent that the higher-level corrections\n(HLC) used in G4MP2 do not do very well for aromatics.\nHowever, in the case of G4, for similarly obtained HLCs, the\nMADs are much better because G4 has less approximations\nthan G4MP2. The average error per nonhydrogen atom in the\nmolecule, shown in Table 3, is quite constant with increasing\nmolecule size, a result consistent with an accumulation of error.\nFor G4MP2A, only 16 of the 185 molecules in Table S1 have\nerrors of 2 kcal/mol or more (only two of which are slightly\ngreater than 3 kcal/mol). Of the 16, these are distributed as\nfollows: 11 are substituted or multiple aromatic rings, three are\nsubstituted alkyl or ether chain molecules, and two are multiple\naliphatic rings.

The problem is\nthat the higher-level correction is assumed to be\nindependent of the element and the type of bonding\ninvolved.\n(2) To address this problem, we have added an atomspeci\ufb01c correction to the higher-level correction, which\nis only dependent on the type of atom, not on the bond\ntype. With this simple addition to the higher-level\ncorrection, we \ufb01nd that a modi\ufb01ed G4MP2", "start_char_idx": 37263, "end_char_idx": 40410, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daedd0e2-51f9-4f51-92c6-317ad7f25309": {"__data__": {"id_": "daedd0e2-51f9-4f51-92c6-317ad7f25309", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7dfb3e9-cbe8-4315-87b1-3aa046ab6479", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "2a79dea31b4a4da9c19510d90488c1deb0ba94371bf93164c4a4dfedf4693251"}, "2": {"node_id": "28c3fefb-a7bf-4821-9c4d-6fa01b7c31dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "a21ea09cb6c4ba11323a5f02d112a7609b0de6c12d7e464f8a89ed43a806e784"}}, "hash": "fe6fc20b76c1ea279e0b831b7883efe8f2cf1aa0f5d30f38cf618cd2c13f87ac", "text": "we \ufb01nd that a modi\ufb01ed G4MP2 method,\nreferred to as G4MP2A, is as accurate as G4 theory for\nthe set of molecules considered here, with a much\nsmaller computational cost.

Generally, ML models are\ntrained on predetermined past data and then used to make predictions for new test cases. Active-learning, however, is a paradigm in\nwhich ML models can direct the learning process itself through providing dynamic suggestions/queries for the \u201cnext-best experiment.\u201d In\nthis work, the authors demonstrate how an active-learning framework can aid in the discovery of polymers possessing high glass transition\ntemperatures (Tg). Starting from an initial small dataset of polymer Tg measurements, the authors use Gaussian process regression in conjunction with an active-learning framework to iteratively add Tg measurements of candidate polymers to the training dataset. The active-learning framework employs one of three decision making strategies (exploitation, exploration, or balanced exploitation/exploration) for selection of\nthe \u201cnext-best experiment.\u201d The active-learning work\ufb02ow terminates once 10 polymers possessing a Tg greater than a certain threshold temperature are selected. The authors statistically benchmark the performance of the aforementioned three strategies (against a random selection\napproach) with respect to the discovery of high-Tg polymers for this particular demonstrative materials design challenge.\n\nIntroduction\nIn order to design new materials for speci\ufb01c applications, we\noften have to search for materials which possess a given set\nof properties within a required window. For example, design\nof polymers for energy storage applications requires that such\nmaterials possess simultaneously high dielectric constant and\nbandgap.[1\u20139] Another example is the design of solid polymer\nelectrolytes for Li-ion batteries. Such materials are required\nto possess a suitably high Li-ion conductivity[10] in conjunction\nwith an appropriate electrochemical window.[11] In order to\nguide this search for materials with promising functionalities,\nscientists and researchers often rely on intuition gained from\npast experiments to design the next set of experiments. Even\nso, how does one decide whether to continue searching within\na particularly promising class of materials or switch to searching\nfor candidates in a more unexplored region of chemical or structural space? Rather than making such decisions based purely\non human intuition, active-learning algorithms that exploit\nBayesian optimization (BO) frameworks may be utilized.[12\u201315]\nOver the past decade, machine-learning (ML)-based algorithms and techniques have been of tremendous utility in a variety of \ufb01elds, including in materials science.[16\u201319] Approaches\nto the ML can roughly be divided into two categories, passive\nand active, each making characteristic assumptions about the\n\n\u2020 Chiho Kim and Anand Chandrasekaran equally contributed to this work.\n\nlearner and its environment.[20] In passive learning approaches\nsuch as classi\ufb01cation, clustering, and regression, the ML algorithm or surrogate model can only make inferences on the environment based on the predetermined training data provided to\nit. Within the active-learning paradigm, however, the learning\nalgorithm can make dynamic queries or suggestions to direct\nthe learning process itself. For instance, when faced with a paucity of training data, the ML algorithm can direct the user to\nprovide data from unexplored regions", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3966, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d308fca8-c503-4ced-a84f-4674e7123a2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d308fca8-c503-4ced-a84f-4674e7123a2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "05beaf8f-10e6-48c8-bd77-ac839618a30f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4327e27d0ff84671c109c364629bb5af565b9c3b44a108f2f00b2cbe2b6bbd2a"}, "2": {"node_id": "01506e4f-3668-4959-9741-b0e94c0dd547", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "4194780755c943aff9c35a38d1d7e2fb496960cdb9d1c69b4a6987d684c4ff64"}, "3": {"node_id": "3aa84fea-e815-4e47-a618-0f060783557e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "1e4ea13ad69c88539879718e1b06bac192f0ae4dedbbcb3e46103c34a0abad2b"}}, "hash": "122f5b04885ad3304099f2a2db3a4a00b7f0ac2011b36cf44b273fc36031d281", "text": "the ML algorithm can direct the user to\nprovide data from unexplored regions (quanti\ufb01ed by the prediction) so as to gain knowledge and improve the overall accuracy\nof the model.

We demonstrate this approach on\na dataset of 736 polymer Tg measurements that we have curated\nfrom various publicly available sources of data.[21\u201323] Our\nresults indicate that all three strategies (exploitation, exploration, and balance exploitation/exploration) consistently outperform a random search approach. We observe that the two\nbest-performing strategies are the balanced exploration/exploration and pure exploitation strategies. We notice that the former is the most robust strategy to employ in \ufb01nding the most\nnumber of high-Tg polymers using the least number of \u201cexperiments,\u201d particularly when the size of the initial dataset is small.\nThe active-learning framework and strategies detailed in this\nwork can be generalized to many materials classes and can\nalso be used to optimize more than one materials property\nsimultaneously.\n\nMethod\nFirst, we randomly select \ufb01ve polymers from the dataset of 736\npolymers, and pretend that we know the Tg value only for these\npolymers. We then train a Gaussian process regression (GPR)\nmodel on just the \ufb01ve randomly selected polymers; the experimental Tg measurements for the remaining 731 polymers are\nkept hidden to the learning algorithm. Although this initial\nmodel is likely highly inaccurate, it provides us with the ability\nto make predictions of Tg (along with the associated uncertainties) on the remaining 731 candidate polymers. As shown\nin Fig. 1, we then use one of the three different strategies\n(explained in the following sections) to iteratively choose the\nnext-best polymer to synthesize and test (from the 731 remaining polymers) so as to achieve our goal of designing a certain\nnumber of high-Tg polymers in the shortest possible time.\nSince this is a demonstrative problem, we do not actually synthesize and test the polymer but instead the Tg of this sixth\n\nrecommended polymer is \u201crevealed\u201d to the learning algorithm\nand added to the training set. A new ML model is trained on\nthese six polymers and predictions are made for the remaining\n730 polymers.

The three strategies utilize\nexploitation (searching close to the area of the current best estimate), exploration (searching in unexplored areas), and balanced\nexploitation/exploration. As explained in more detail in the\n\u201cWork\ufb02ow\u201d section, the exploitation strategy uses only predicted\nTg to provide suggestions for the next-best polymer to synthesize\nand test.

The \ufb01rst one is at the\natomic scale wherein the occurrence of atomic triples (or a\nset of three contiguous atoms, e.g., C2\u2013C3\u2013C4, made up of a\ntwofold coordinated oxygen, a threefold coordinated carbon,\nand a fourfold coordinated carbon) was calculated.[28,29] For\nthe polymers considered in this study, there are 123 such components. The next level deals with quantitative structure property relationship descriptors, such as van der Waals surface\narea,[30] topological surface area,[31,32] and fraction of rotatable\n\nbonds,[33] implemented in the RDKit cheminformatics\nlibrary.[34] Such descriptors, 99 in total, form the next set of\ncomponents of our overall \ufb01ngerprint. The third level and largest length scale descriptors captured morphological features\nsuch as the topological distance between rings, fraction of\natoms that are part of side chains and length of largest side\nchain.[27] We include a \ufb01xed set of 22 such morphological\ndescriptors.\n\nWork\ufb02ow\nAs mentioned earlier, we set an arbitrary goal of \ufb01nding 10\npolymers possessing a Tg greater than 450 K. To achieve this\nobjective, we would have to perform a series of virtual experiments, on one polymer at a time, to obtain the true experimental\nvalue of Tg for that polymer.

Once the ML\nmodel has been built by training on the initial dataset, Tg values\nfor the candidate polymers are predicted. We investigated the\nperformance of three decision-making strategies (or acquisition\nfunctions); exploitation, exploration, and balanced exploitation/\nexploration, that employ different approaches (based on different\ncriteria) to provide suggestions for the next-best experiment.\n\u2022 Strategy 1\u2014Exploitation: In this strategy the next-best polymer is the one that has the highest predicted Tg value. This\nprediction is obtained from an ML model trained on previous\nexperiments. The exploitation approach favors polymers that\nare chemically similar to high-Tg polymers in the training set.\n\u2022 Strategy 2\u2014Exploration: Here, the next-best candidate is the\none which displays the largest uncertainty (as predicted by the\nGPR model). Such an approach favors exploration of chemical space in order to acquire more information about the\nglobal landscape of Tg variation across all the polymers to\nbe tested. As such, this strategy is not optimal for the targeted\nsearch of high-Tg polymers but we analyze the performance\nof this approach nonetheless.\n\u2022 Strategy 3\u2014Balanced exploitation/exploration: We utilize\nthe maximum expected improvement (EI) acquisition function[13,35] to utilize both the prediction and uncertainty to provide the suggestion for the next-best polymer candidate. For\nexample, especially in the early stages of the dataset expansion, a particular polymer may not possess the highest predicted Tg but it may possess an unusually large uncertainty.\nSince the EI criterion takes into account both the prediction\nand the uncertainty, such a polymer may indeed be the\nmost likely candidate for the next experiment. Within our\nGPR-based ML framework, the calculated EI metric is nonparametric and it automatically (and dynamically) provides\na balance between exploration and exploitation approaches.\nThe equations for the evaluation of the EI metric are shown\nin the Appendix.\n\u2022 Strategy 4\u2014Random selection: In this strategy, we randomly\nselect a new candidate polymer, at every iteration, and add it\u2019s\nTg value to the list of \u201cknown\u201d Tg values.
