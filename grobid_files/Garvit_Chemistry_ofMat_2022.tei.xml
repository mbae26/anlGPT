<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Redox flow batteries (RFBs) are a promising technology for stationary energy storage applications due to their flexible design, scalability, and low cost. In RFBs, energy is carried in flowable redoxactive materials (redoxmers) which are stored externally and pumped to the cell during operation. Further improvements in the energy density of RFBs necessitates redoxmer designs with wider redox potential windows and higher solubility. Additionally, designing redoxmers with a fluorescence-enabled self-reporting functionality allows monitoring of the state of health of RFBs. To accelerate the discovery of redoxmers with desired properties, state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) methods, such as multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MBO), are useful. Here, we first employed density functional theory calculations to generate a database of reduction potentials, solvation free energies, and absorption wavelengths for 1400 redoxmer molecules based on a 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BzNSN) core structure. From the computed properties, we identified 22 Pareto-optimal molecules that represent best trade-off among all of the desired properties. We further utilized these data to develop and benchmark an MBO approach to identify candidates quickly and efficiently with multiple targeted properties. With MBO, optimal candidates from the 1400-molecule data set can be identified at least 15 times more efficiently compared to the brute force or random selection approach. Importantly, we utilized this approach for discovering promising redoxmers from an unseen database of 1 million BzNSN-based molecules, where we discovered 16 new Pareto-optimal molecules with significant improvements in properties over the initial 1400 molecules. We anticipate that this active learning technique is general and can be utilized for the discovery of any class of functional materials that satisfies multiple desired property criteria.</p></div>

For example, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BzNSN) is a well-studied anolyte redoxmer (which undergoes reduction) in NRFBs that features low redox potential, low molecular weight, high stability of the charged radical anion, and outstanding electrochemical cycling performance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[10]</ref> Recently, a BzNSN derivative, CH 3 -AcBzC 6 , was engineered with a π-extended acetamide group, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> which enabled an orthogonal molecular property, namely fluorescence, to monitor the crossover of the active species and assess the state of health of the battery. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> Hence, one promising strategy for designing anolyte redoxmers is to perform molecular engineering of the BzNSN scaffold using a wide range of functional groups to achieve the desired properties (e.g., using electron-withdrawing/-donating groups to tune the redox potential). However, high-throughput experimental synthesis and characterization are often a significant bottleneck, and high-fidelity computational methods provide a cost-efficient alternative to enable the design and discovery.</p><p>To accelerate the materials discovery, high-fidelity density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been used to screen large molecular libraries and guide experiments toward the most optimal candidate molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[15]</ref> The computed properties, such as redox potentials of the organic molecules, are observed to be in good agreement with the experimentally measured values using cyclic voltammetry. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[18]</ref> Thus, a combination of molecular engineering and high-throughput DFT calculations is routinely used to identify redoxmer candidates with desired redox potentials for application in NRFBs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20</ref> For example, Pelzer et al. have performed highthroughput DFT calculations to screen molecules with desired reduction and oxidation potentials from a library of 4178 molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> Similarly, DFT calculations have been used to develop linear regression models to predict the solubilities of the organic molecules using the computed solvation free energies and dipole moments of the molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref> While such high-throughput material-screening approaches are attractive, the brute-force computational screening methods become intractable as the size of the search space grows beyond a few thousand candidates.</p><p>The recent emergence of data-driven and machine learning (ML) techniques has accelerated the screening of large search spaces for the identification of molecules/materials with desired properties.

The goal of AL is to strike a good balance between the exploitation and exploration to minimize the number of computations or experimental measurements needed to optimize the property of a given material system or achieve the desired accuracy of the trained ML model. For example, AL has been successfully used to guide the experiments to accelerate the discovery of new shape-memory alloys with low thermal hysteresis from a search space of 800k compositions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">40</ref> and to tune the measured electrostrain of the Pb-free piezoelectric materials. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">41</ref> Bassman et al. used an AL model based on Bayesian optimization (BO) to discover layered materials with optimal band gaps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42</ref> Similarly, Kim et al. used AL to search for polymers with high glass transition temperatures using few DFT evaluations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref> Recently, we used the BO framework to identify redoxmers with optimum oxidation potentials for application in NRFBs from a large search space of 112k molecules by performing only 100 DFT calculations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> While a specific property of redoxmers such as redox potential, solubility, or even fluorescence may be efficiently identified via singleobjective AL, it is always more desirable, albeit challenging, to search for redoxmers with multiple optimized properties.

Although the stability of anolyte molecules is also an important criterion for designing long-duration RFBs, it is a function of multiple factors (redox potential window, solvation structure, reactivity Scheme 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>2.1. Structure Enumeration and DFT Calculations of BzNSN Molecules. A molecular data set is generated by engineering the substituent (R 1 -R 5 ) positions in the scaffold of the acetamide-substituted BzNSN molecule with different functional groups as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>. The use of the simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) allows for fast and robust text-based enumeration, resulting in a data set of c.a. 1400 BzNSN molecules. This data set consists of seven chemical elements, H, Br, C, N, O, S, and F. The size of molecules ranges from 20 to 36 heavy atoms (non-H atoms). Before DFT evaluations, the initial 3D molecular structures are automatically generated from SMILES representations and subsequently optimized using the MMF94 forcefield as implemented in the RDKit cheminformatics package. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> Then, DFT calculations are performed to compute the reduction potentials (E red ), solvation free energies (G solv ), and absorption wavelengths (λ abs ) of the molecules (see the Computational Details section). The distributions of the computed E red , G solv , and λ abs values of the 1400 BzNSN molecule data set are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b-d</ref>, respectively. The computed properties are observed to vary over a wide range of values, indicating a diverse data set of molecular properties. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, the computed reduction potential (E red ) varies in the range of ∼1.5 to ∼3.0 V vs Li/Li + . As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, the computed solvation free energy (G solv ) varies in the range of -1.2 to -0.2 eV. Also, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, the computed absorption wavelength varies from 300 to 500 nm. The statistics (minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation) of the computed properties (E red , G solv , and λ abs ) are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Among the computed properties, a lower E red is crucial to expand the electrochemical window of the active species and thus helps to improve the operating voltage of an NRFB. A more negative G solv (from DFT) is a reasonable indicator of the higher solubility of the BzNSN anolytes in acetonitrile solvent, which can result in the increased concentration of the active species in solution. We note that the actual solubility measurements using computations are not possible due to the lack of sublimation energies of the molecular materials. In a recent work, Robertson et al. have identified that BzNSN molecules with λ abs values ranging from 350 to 400 nm exhibit fluorescence activity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">11</ref> Our DFT calculations of a subset of 1400 BzNSNs also confirm that molecules with λ abs in this range possess the emission wavelength (λ em ) in the visible range (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Since the computational evaluation of λ em is significantly more expensive than that of λ abs , we used the latter as an approximate screening indicator of the fluorescence activity. Particularly, to search for new molecules that are easily detectable via fluorescence activity in the electrolyte solutions, a target value of 375 nm is considered desirable for λ abs . The ideal material candidate must therefore be designed by minimizing the values of E red , G solv , and |λ abs -375| concurrently. Unlike the single-property optimization, simulta-  neous optimization of multiple properties requires the identification of the Pareto front, in which the Pareto-optimal data points represent the best trade-off among properties.</p><p>Here, we have used an AL strategy based on MBO to accelerate the search of the Pareto-optimal data points while utilizing a minimal number of expensive DFT calculations. 2.2. Multiobjective Bayesian Optimization. MBO is a class of multiobjective optimization in which a surrogate model, for example, Gaussian process regression (GPR, see the Computational Details section), is used to search for the optimal candidates based on improvement metrics such as the expected improvement (EI, see the Computational Details section). By defining how the EI of a multiobjective function may be evaluated, several methods have been proposed in the recent literature. In one approach by Knowles, called ParEGO, N objectives are aggregated into a single objective via parameterized scalarizing weight factors, and a single-objective EI is then used for the resulting single-objective function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">49</ref> Further modifications of ParEGO for improved computational speed and efficiency were also proposed by Liu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">50</ref> and Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51</ref> Recently, Hase and colleagues introduced a new lexicographical approach to combine multiple objectives into one, in which the contribution from each objective is based on its hierarchical order of importance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">52</ref> In the case where objective aggregation is not preferred, either a multipleobjective EI or multiple single-objective EIs must be evaluated with respect to a Pareto front. For example, Keane derives a two-objective EI equation that computes the probability of augmenting the current Pareto front so that a new dominating solution can be determined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">53</ref> The magnitude of improvement is then calculated with respect to the closest point on the current Pareto front. In another approach, the improvement metrics is defined by the S-metric or hypervolume increment to the Pareto front and can be computed using the EI in the hypervolume formulation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">55</ref> In general, multiobjective EI equations are mathematically complex and may not be easily expanded to large number of objectives (N objective &gt; 2). A possible approach to circumvent such difficulty is to employ multiple single-objective EI equations. As shown by Jeong and Obayashi, for every candidate, an EI will be computed for each objective, and the resulting set of EIs is treated as fitness values for selecting the optimal candidate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">56</ref> Beyond MBO, it is important to mention that Jablonka and co-workers recently proposed a novel multiobjective AL algorithm that optimizes toward the Pareto front by directly using the GPR-predicted mean and uncertainty values. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> In this work, we employ a similar approach to Jeong and Obayashi's method, in which the EIs for different objectives are computed independently, followed by the construction of a Pareto front in the EI space. The main advantage of our approach lies in the efficient implementation that enables the evaluation of multidimensional Pareto front in large data sets (a 3D Pareto front and up to 1 million data points in this work).</p><p>The overall scheme for our MBO workflow is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Similar to our recently described single-objective BO scheme for identifying molecules with desired oxidation potential, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> the preprocessing step (green) consists of feature generation for the entire candidate library, followed by random selection of 10 BzNSN molecules. The molecular properties of interest, E red , G solv , and λ abs , are computed using DFT simulations and used as the initial data set for the training of the GPR models (red). Then, GPR-predicted properties and uncertainties of the remaining candidates are used to calculate three sets of EI values, where each set corresponds to a property. The candidate(s) with the Pareto-optimal EI combination is chosen for the next round of DFT simulations, and the cycle is repeated. Perhaps, the main differences between single-objective BO and MBO lie in the training of different GPR models for different properties and the use of the EI and Pareto front evaluation to determine the subsequent training data. These specific components, that is, feature generation from SMILES strings, GPR model training, and candidate selection from the multidimensional EI will be discussed next.</p><p>2.2.1. Feature Generation. To build robust ML models for property prediction, it is critical to design features/fingerprints to numerically represent each molecule. It is also important to recognize that the generated features should uniquely represent the molecule and should be easy to compute for any new molecule. Here, we use the RDKit cheminformatics package <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48</ref> to generate such a set of 125 features using various physical and chemical properties of the molecules (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> of the Supporting Information). Based on the Pearson correlation analysis, we identified that no single feature among the original 125 features can reliably capture the trend of the computed E red , G solv , or λ abs values (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S2-S4</ref>). After feature normalization, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector. From PCA, a total of 22 principal components (PCs) are found to be sufficient to account for 100% variance in the data (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref> of the Supporting Information). The graphical illustration of the chemical space of the 1400 BzNSN data set is also shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S6</ref>. Thus, feature vectors consisting of 22 PCs are used as inputs for property predictions. We note that the feature generation protocol is consistent with our recent study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> 2.2.2. GPR Models. GPR is used to train a separate predictive model for each of the three properties in the computed data set. The details of the GPR model are provided in the Computational Details section. The performance of the trained GPR models is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the root mean square error (RMSE) as the error metrics. The entire dataset of 1400 BzNSN molecules is split into training and test sets. To determine the optimal training/test ratio, we examine the learning curves that are generated by systematically increasing the size of the training set from 10 to 90% of the total data set. The corresponding remaining data are used as test sets to evaluate the performance of the model. To generate statistically meaningful results, 100 evaluations are performed for each training set size, and the reported test RMSE values are calculated as the average of these 100 runs.</p><p>The learning curves for the three properties (E red , G solv , and λ abs ) depicting the variation of the average test RMSE as a function of the training set size are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a-c</ref>. The error bars denote 1 standard deviation (1σ) of the average RMSE values for the 100 runs. The plots include the learning curves for the model trained using all the original 125 features as well as the reduced feature vector of 22 PCs. The GPR models trained using the reduced feature vector of 22 PCs result in a similar performance as compared to the models trained using all 125 features. This shows that PCA is an    for reduction potential, 57 meV for solvation free energy, and 15 nm for absorption wavelength. The parity plots (i.e., GPRpredicted property vs DFT-computed property) comparing the performance of the final GPR models trained with 70% training data using 22 PCs as the feature vector are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>-f. The error bars in each parity plot represent the GPR uncertainty. The high R 2 coefficients of 0.94, 0.87, and 0.82 on the test set for the reduction potential, solvation free energy, and absorption wavelength, respectively, indicate the good accuracy of the trained GPR models.</p><p>2.2.3. Candidate Selection Using the Pareto-Optimal EI. In single-objective BO, the current optimal (e.g., minimum or maximum) value in the training set is used as the reference for computing the improvement metrics associated with the candidates in the test data set. With EI formulation, the candidate with the maximum EI value yields the maximum potential to improve over the existing reference and is selected for evaluation. In the case of MBO, however, the Pareto front in the training set dictates the choice of the reference value(s). All members of a Pareto front are considered equivalent, and an improvement over any one of them will warrant a new Pareto front. Hence, the choice of which Pareto-optimal point should be the reference value is a matter of strategic preference. In this work, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, we choose the data point with the maximum, noninfinite, crowding distance (see the Computational Details section) on the Pareto front of the training data set as the reference for EI evaluations (the solid red circle in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>).</p><p>As the Pareto-optimal reference is identified, the improvement region over this point in the property space may be explored as indicated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>. This reference point and the GPR-predicted mean and uncertainty values of the test set are then used to compute the EI values for every property. Thus, we obtain a multidimensional improvement metrics with the same number of dimensions as the property space (here, it is three dimensions). Therefore, finding a candidate with the optimal improvement over the reference point in all dimensions of the property space is now equivalent to picking one with the maximum multidimensional EI value. Then, the task is to identify Pareto-optimal points in the EI space. Since the number of possible Pareto-optimal candidates increase exponentially with respect to the number of EI dimensions and the size of the data set, they should be strategically selected for evaluation for the optimal computational efficiency. In the single-point selection approach shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>, we choose only the Pareto-optimal candidate with the maximum crowding distance for DFT evaluations. Although this approach increases the size of the DFT-evaluated/training data set slowly, it provides consistent improvement of the GPR models with limited computational resources. When concurrent DFT evaluations of multiple Pareto-optimal candidates are feasible, a set number of candidates may be collected via Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[59]</ref> As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, in the LHS approach, the selection of data points on the EI Pareto front is evenly spaced in all dimensions and hence diversified.</p><p>2.3. MBO Performance on the 1400 BzNSN Molecule Data Set. As mentioned earlier, our multiobjective goal is to minimize the reduction potentials (E red ) and solvation free energies (G solv ) while targeting the desired absorption wavelength (λ abs ) of 375 nm. For the 1400 BzNSN data set, there are 22 data points/molecules that form the true Pareto front or the optimal solution set, as shown by the solid stars in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>. The 2D chemical structures and the computed properties (E red , G solv , and λ abs ) of these Pareto-optimal molecules are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> (IDs: 1-22). To evaluate the performance of our MBO approach, we performed 100 iterations (equivalent to 100 molecule property evaluations) on the 1400 BzNSN data set. After every iteration, the next molecule is suggested using the single-point selection method based on the crowding distance as described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>. We also repeat the procedure 100 times, each using a different initial training set of 10 randomly selected data points, to obtain meaningful statistics.</p><p>A well-known metric for evaluating the performance of MBO methods is the hypervolume indicator, which is the volume enclosed by connecting the Pareto-optimal points to a chosen reference point in the multiobjective space. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">60</ref> For computing the hypervolumes, we use a reference point consisting of three components, each of which is slightly larger than the extremum (maximum) in each property dimension, that is, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61</ref> As different solution sets/Pareto fronts yield different hypervolume values, they can be directly used for comparison. Typically, a higher hypervolume indicates a better set of Pareto-optimal points, and it follows that the true Pareto front corresponds to the maximum hypervolume. For the 1400 BzNSN data set, we can calculate the maximum hypervolume as the true Pareto front has been identified. Using the maximum hypervolume as the target, the performance of our MBO can be benchmarked against random selection. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref> shows the hypervolume percentage (with respect to the maximum hypervolume) obtained by MBO and random selection as a function of the number of evaluations. Two observations can be made from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b</ref>. First, based on the shaded areas, which indicate 1σ around the mean, MBO provides more stable solution sets compared to random selection. Second, the Pareto-optimal molecules suggested by MBO reach the quality of the true Pareto front at a significantly faster pace than their randomly selected counterparts. Specifically, to achieve 99% of the maximum hypervolume, MBO only requires 74 molecule evaluations, whereas random selection needs to investigate a total of 1126 molecules on average. Therefore, our MBO approach provides at least a 15-fold improvement in the efficiency over random selection. The distribution of the number of Pareto-optimal molecules found in each of the 100 MBO runs is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S7</ref> of the Supporting Information. Similarly, the statistics of the number of successful runs and the number of evaluations required to find each of the 22 Pareto-optimal molecules are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S8</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> of the Supporting Information.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E ref red &gt; E max red (3.38 V), G ref solv &gt; G max solv (-0.29 eV), λ ref solv &gt; λ ref solv (487 nm).</formula><p>2.4. Application of MBO on an Unseen Molecule Data Set of 1 Million BzNSNs. To demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the MBO approach, we applied it to a significantly larger and new molecular data set. This new data set was generated by expanding the molecular candidate library (similar to Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) with more diverse substituents ("R" positions) in the molecular scaffold. The complete list of functional groups used for the generation of this large molecular data set is provided in Table <ref type="table">S3</ref> of the Supporting Information. We limit the maximum number of heavy atoms (non-H atoms) in the molecules to 40 to maintain a reasonable computational cost for DFT calculations. The final data set consists of 1 million BzNSN molecules. Our goal is to discover new Pareto-optimal molecules that potentially outperform the existing 22 molecules (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, IDs 1-22) with the minimum number of DFT calculations. For this data set, we employ the multipoint selection strategy described in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>, in which 10 molecules are suggested for DFT evaluations in every MBO cycle, and a total of 10 cycles or 100-molecule property evaluations (DFT) are performed. Due to the higher diversity and complexity of BzNSN molecules in the new data set, the evaluation of the three properties for each of the 100 new molecules using DFT is considerably more expensive. Thus, the number of MBO cycles was limited to 10 to strike a balance between the computational cost and the discovery of new molecules with improved properties. The SMILES strings, computed reduction potentials, solvation free energies, and absorption wavelengths of the molecules are given in Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>.</p><p>In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a</ref>, 100 MBO-evaluated molecules from the 1 million BzNSN data set (red) are plotted together with the initial data set of 1400 BzNSNs (blue). For ease of visualization and analysis, the three properties are also projected on individual dimensions of |λ abs -375|, G solv , and E red in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6b-d</ref>, respectively. To accurately determine if any of the 100 molecules suggested by MBO yields property improvement over the 1400 BzNSN data set, we combine them together and re-evaluate the Pareto-optimal molecules. If a new Pareto front is identified, it is an indication that molecules with more desirable properties have been discovered. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6a-d</ref>    set suggested by our MBO from the 1 million BzNSN data set. The 2D structures and properties of these 16 molecules are tabulated in Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> (BzNSN 23-38, see the Supporting Information). Among the new Pareto-optimal molecules, two new extrema are identified for E red and G solv in BzNSN 34 and 37, respectively, and both provide significant improvement over the previous desired limits (1.54 V → 1.30 V and -1.19 → -1.69 eV). For the third objective, in which λ abs is targeted toward 375 nm, no improvement is found since the existing extremum is already near the desired value (BzNSN 15 with λ abs = 374.98). Importantly, we identify four MBO-suggested molecules from the 1 million BzNSN data set, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> (BzNSN ID 26, 29, 33, and 35), that possess both lower E red and lower G solv values compared to the entire 1400 BzNSN data set while maintaining the λ abs in the desirable range of 350-400 nm (|λ abs -375| ≤ 25). These results indicate the high efficiency and robustness of our MBO approach for identifying redoxmers of multiple design criteria. However, it is important to discuss the current practicality of our MBO-suggested solutions, especially in the case of molecular design. As seen in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S5</ref> in the Supporting Information, many of the suggested Pareto-optimal BzNSN molecules are complex and therefore difficult to synthesize. To circumvent this problem and create a more seamless interaction with experiments, future implementation of MBO will consider synthesizability <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">63</ref> as an additional and necessary criterion. Although our MBO algorithm has been optimized to evaluate over 10 6 data points with N ≥ 2 objectives efficiently, one remaining bottleneck is the speed of property evaluations via molecular simulations. Hence, the overall efficiency of our method also depends on the complexity of the materials and their properties of interest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The discovery of new and improved organic materials is essential for developing the RFB technology, and atomistic simulations and AI-based approaches can provide design guidelines to accelerate materials development. For NRFB technology, molecules must satisfy multiple criteria such as redox potential windows, solubility, stability, rheology, conductivity, and other self-reporting/-repairing properties. In this work, high-throughput DFT calculations were first carried out to evaluate the reduction potentials, solvation free energies, and absorption wavelengths of 1400 BzNSN molecules to search for the ideal anolyte redoxmers for NRFBs. Twenty-two Pareto-optimal BzNSN molecules that best compromise all three properties were identified and suggested for experimental validation. To accelerate the discovery of the Pareto-optimal candidates while keeping the computational cost minimal, an AL model based on MBO was developed and benchmarked on the 1400 BzNSN molecule data set. The results indicate at least a 15-fold efficiency improvement over random selection in searching the optimal molecules. Finally, when applied to a new molecular data set consisting of 1 million BzNSNs, our MBO quickly identified 16 new Pareto-optimal molecules with significant property improvement over the 1400 BzNSN data set. Our robust and flexible multiobjective AL approach provides an accelerated discovery framework for multicriteria functional materials.</p></div>
