Abstract
Polymers are incredibly versatile materials and have become ubiquitous. Increasingly, researchers are using data science and
polymer informatics to design new materials and understand their structure–property relationships. Polymer informatics
is an emerging ﬁeld. While there are many useful tools and databases available, many are not widely utilized. Herein,
we introduce the ﬁeld of polymer informatics and discuss some of the available databases and tools. We cover how to share
polymer data, approaches for preparing a dataset for machine learning and recent applications of machine learning to polymer
property prediction and polymer synthesis.

Polymers are a critical material class due to their wide availability,
range of properties and high tuneability. However, rational design
of polymers is challenging due to the variety of aspects that inﬂuence their properties and performance.1 For example, the
monomer(s) structure, synthesis method and processing control
the chemical structure, morphology and hence properties of the
ﬁnal polymer.2 Additionally, researchers are increasingly considering sustainability of monomer sourcing, interactions between a
polymer and its environment, polymer aging behavior and end of
life (whether as waste, or recyclable).3,4 These relationships are
schematically shown in Fig. 1. These considerations – and more –
mean any given monomer leads to a variety of properties, and
desired properties may be accessed through a variety of monomers. For example, low-density polyethylene and high-density
polyethylene have the same monomer but very different mechanical properties, and polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl
chloride are all used to make similar plastic bottles. As a result, traditional research methods using trial and error based on chemical
intuition are often insufﬁcient to fully design solutions to polymer
innovation and discovery.5 Data-driven and informatics-based
approaches are needed to move the ﬁeld forward faster.6
Recent advances in drug development and the successes of the
Materials Genome Initiative7–10 are examples illustrating the beneﬁts of an informatics-based approach.11 Data-driven research
can dramatically accelerate discovery, and lead to improved performance.12 Understanding which structures lead to speciﬁc
properties (informatics) offers insights about underlying
structure–function relationships.13 Data-driven approaches also
allow inverse design, where a desired property (or properties) is
identiﬁed, and data are used to determine what structure(s) corresponds to that property.9,14 Done properly, data-driven research
allows researchers to move beyond their own intuition, experience and biases to discover connections that were previously
unimagined.

Polymer informatics is a relatively new ﬁeld, but one with rapidly
growing importance. Polymer informatics has been applied to
essentially every aspect of the polymer lifecycle. It has been used
to design new monomers for various applications12,15,16; engineer
reactions17; model processing conditions and parameters18–20;
identify and predict polymer conformations and phases21–26;
predict materials properties27–35; and ﬁnally offer insight into wear
and end of life.4,36–39 Most polymer informatics literature focuses
on property prediction, but recently other aspects of polymer synthesis, processing and lifetime have been gaining attention.14,17,40
There are still many areas ripe for an informatics approach, such
as designing for longer term stability or circular economies.
In this mini-review we discuss necessary tools for polymer informatics. We aim to provide a starting point for the non-specialist
to understand the tools and methods that currently exist in this
rapidly evolving ﬁeld. The data and databases section focuses on

useful collections of information and speciﬁc tools to use for sharing data in the most accessible ways. Often, the best way to understand a dataset is through machine learning (ML) (i.e. regression
and classiﬁcation). To do this ML, we need accurate representations, so the polymer representation and featurization section
focuses on popular approaches of developing ML input. This
includes ﬁngerprinting techniques for monomers and whole polymers, as well as alternative approaches such as graph-based
methods. In the ﬁnal section, ML approaches, we discuss commonly used methods, along with examples of each approach.

DATA AND DATABASES

538

Informatics is all about data, and as such, high-quality data are of
paramount importance. ML is particularly sensitive to data quality,
as it is very sensitive to artifacts,41–43 and is poor at extrapolation.44 Therefore, it is important to identify and account for any
biases in a dataset, and gather large datasets.45 Despite a wide
array of available materials databases, it is often challenging
to ﬁnd a complete dataset relevant to a speciﬁc research
question. In contrast to synthetic macromolecules, there are many
small-molecule databases with millions of entries (ZINC,46
ChemSpider,47 PubChem,48 ChEMBL,49,50 and many more), with
extensive property data for each entry. The number of highquality materials databases is growing, but most databases only
have hundreds or thousands of entries, representing a much
smaller chemical space than the small-molecule databases. Additionally, initiatives to expand and create materials databases10,51
are divided between inorganic materials and soft materials. For
polymers, databases of interest are PolyInfo,52 the extension of
PolyInfo PI1M,53 and the Khazana54 databases. We note that to
accelerate polymer informatics the community needs a validated

and curated database and repository where researchers can
deposit new polymer data, similar to the Cambridge Structural
Database,55 but containing property data as well as characterization data. An additional source of polymer data is handbooks.
Polymer data handbooks have a broad array of data, and while
most would require some effort to make the data accessible to a
computer,56,57 some are fully accessible online.58
The imprecision of polymer naming conventions is a hurdle to
widespread polymer data sharing. Traditionally, polymer names
indicate what repeat units are incorporated, and, if relevant, the
relationship between comonomers (e.g. random or block) and
tacticity. However, given the stochastic nature of polymers more
precise information on structure is omitted. If a database of polymer information is going to be useful to a researcher who did not
generate it, the new researcher must be able to understand the
precise identity and nature of the entries in the database. This is
especially important if multiple sources of data are being combined to develop a sufﬁciently large database for a speciﬁc problem. The polymer informatics community needs to settle on a
standard method of detailing polymer structures and data. One
approach to developing a standard schema for polymer data sharing is PolyDat.59 PolyDat is designed to include all relevant data
for a polymer, including characterization data, synthesis procedures and information on all relevant species and post-functionalization. An overview of the PolyDat schema is shown in Fig. 2(a).
There are three key parts of the PolyDat schema: preamble, species and transformations. The preamble contains all the metadata,
reaction network information and data provenance. It gives all the
information needed to understand the other sections. The species
section contains all the characterization data on all the species in
the reaction network. This characterization data can be of any
type. The transformations section includes information on all the
reactions (both synthesis and any post-synthetic modiﬁcations),
including the reaction procedures. Use of a standard data schema
will greatly increase the ability of researchers to extract published
results.

POLYMER REPRESENTATION AND
FEATURIZATION
An accurate ML model requires inputs (features) that describe the
system of interest. An accurate useful model depends on properly
chosen and designed features.60,61 Features are a wide range of
items, from properties of atoms (e.g. partial charge, atomic number)
in the molecule of interest, to calculated electronic properties
(HOMO, LUMO, etc.), to measured experimental values (e.g. glass
transition temperature, heat capacity), to reaction or processing conditions24,62 (temperature, pH, etc.). The critical requirement for a feature set is that it accurately and uniquely describes each data point in
a machine-readable format. Often, the lengthiest stage in a ML project is identifying which features are needed, which are superﬂuous
and what is the best method to generate those features.
Some ML models for the prediction of polymer properties may
achieve high accuracy solely using features based on monomers.63
Monomer-based features range in complexity from constitutional
descriptors (number of rings, number of heavy atoms, etc.), to
two-dimensional representations (atomic connectivity, topological
descriptors, molecular graphs, etc.), to three-dimensional geometric descriptors (computationally generated or crystallography
based), to four-dimensional conformational ensemble descriptors.64 Two common approaches for developing monomer-based
features are ﬁngerprinting62,64,65 and graph-based methods.

completely capture the stochastic nature of polymers,73,74 especially for copolymers.75 These compositions are complex mixtures
and mixtures are fundamentally different from pure substances.
Simple average values, while easy to measure, may not fully capture
the richer complexity in the underlying distributions. For example,
molecular weight, comonomer composition and comonomer
sequence will differ from one chain to the next. How do the distributions of these structural characteristics correlate to properties?76
Properly representing the dispersity and sequence variations inherent to polymers is an open question.77,78
In small-molecule research, ﬁngerprinting and feature generation
often use SMILES79 (Simpliﬁed Molecular Input Line Entry System)
strings as input. The SMILES notation system is widely used for small
molecules as it is machine-readable and well suited for informatics
purposes. However, the stochastic nature of polymers and their
size make using SMILES for polymers inefﬁcient and awkward.
BigSMILES74 adds the ability to deﬁne repeat units, copolymers
and polymer structures (such as branched, star, etc.) clearly and easily to the SMILES system. Figure 2(b) shows a schematic representation of a few of the ways BigSMILES represents polymers. While there
are other ongoing efforts to improve SMILES (i.e. SELFIES,80 a selfreferencing approach that is more robust than traditional SMILES),
the BigSMILES approach is sufﬁciently ﬂexible to still be one of the
clearest and easiest methods of providing a polymer structural
deﬁnition. Wide adoption of BigSMILES notation, especially within
databases, will aid in making data fully accessible to all researchers.

ML APPROACHES
Two types of ML commonly used in polymer informatics are supervised and unsupervised learning (Fig. 3).44,81 Supervised learning
uses data where the label is known. For example, performing a

Fingerprinting involves converting geometric and chemical information to a numerical representation.66 Most often, the numerical
representation is a vector of ﬁxed length, where each component
in the vector represents a different characteristic of the monomer.
A properly designed ﬁngerprinting technique gives a unique ﬁngerprint for each unique monomer. Fingerprints can be based on
purely atomic neighborhoods,65 or on the molecule as a whole.62,64
Graph-based methods require a large number of data points and
typically use neural nets to predict or classify polymers using a
descriptor-free approach. Examples of this approach have been
reported recently.67,68 The selection of appropriate methods
depends on the size of the available dataset and the chemical information available about each monomer.
A polymeric ﬁngerprint54 is appropriate when the behaviors or
properties being modeled are dependent on the bulk structure
of the polymer. Polymer ﬁngerprints are created with a wide variety of details. The simplest method is to encode the identity of the
building block, and the count of each type of building block. Additional complexity is added by including information about the
relationships between types of building blocks, clearly identifying
the difference between a random copolymer and an alternating
or block copolymer.54 However, a different approach is needed
to include atomic and molecular properties. The Ramprasad
group has developed a highly successful ﬁngerprinting technique
for polymers that includes information about every level of the
molecule, from chain-speciﬁc values to atomic properties. This
method starts with atomic-triple ﬁngerprints,69 adds molecular
descriptors from RDKit,70 then identiﬁes commonly occurring substructures or blocks and ﬁnally adds polymer-chain-speciﬁc
descriptors such as side-chain length.71 This multilevel approach
to ﬁngerprinting performs well in predicting polymer properties.54,71,72 However, most ﬁngerprint approaches do not

regression ﬁt for predicting glass transition temperature, where all
the training data have a known glass transition temperature.82
Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. It is most commonly
used to identify clusters or groups within data, such as autoidentifying nanocluster shapes in a molecular dynamics dataset.83 Unsupervised learning can also be used for autoencoding. Autoencoders are
a deep learning technique that independently learns how to encode
or represent the training data.80,84 Supervised and unsupervised
learning are combined in semi-supervised and active learning. These
techniques use a small subset of labeled data to assign labels85
or predict outcomes for a larger, unlabeled, dataset.86 Semisupervised learning is very effective for labeling clusters and
classiﬁcation. Active learning iteratively identiﬁes the unlabeled
data that will most improve the model if the label was added,
guiding experimental data collection. There are a wide variety
of tools and packages available for polymer informatics. Some
of the most commonly used tools include RDKit,87,88 Pybel,89 SciKit Learn44 and Pymatgen.90
Supervised learning is the most common type of ML used in
polymer informatics. Structure-to-property predictions are usually
generated using supervised learning. The general process for this
approach is to gather data (either from experimental/simulation
data or from a database), verify that all data are comparable and
have accurate labels, build a ML model to predict the property,
before ﬁnally using the model on a new data point to predict
the outcome. There are many examples in the literature using this
approach. Supervised learning with a deep neural network has
been used to predict solvents and non-solvents for a polymer91
and polymer phase transitions.25 Regression models can predict
refractive indices of linear polymers92 and erosion behavior of silicon carbide-reinforced polymer composites.4 Supervised learning is most effective and useful when there is a large accurate
dataset available for training, and directly measuring the predicted property is an intensive process. Ideally, all models of this
type would be shared in a format that makes them useable to
researchers without having to recreate the training process. One
excellent example of sharing predictive models widely is the Polymer Genome,54,72,93 which predicts a large number of properties

from either the polymer name, the SMILES string for the repeat
unit, or a drawing of the repeat unit.
Unsupervised learning has been used very effectively to solve
inverse design problems in materials or polymer science.15,22,25,63,94–96 In an inverse design problem, the desired
properties are known, but the suitable molecule/polymer to
achieve those properties is unknown.77,97–99 In these problems a
combination of autoencoders (unsupervised learning) and supervised learning often delivers accurate predictions. This approach
is especially useful in situations where multiple properties must
be optimized. Autoencoders in tandem with regression models
have been used to predict polymers that are robust under high
temperatures and high electric ﬁelds,15 ﬁnd polymers suited for
solar cells61,63 and predict polymer phases and phase transitions.25,26 Unsupervised learning has also been applied to identify
defects94 and conformation states.22,95 In these applications, selforganizing mapping96 and clustering are used to identify subsets
of data and determine which characteristics separate subclasses.
For small datasets, semi-supervised or active learning combines
supervised and unsupervised learning to leverage a small starting
dataset for large learning gains. While there are only a few examples in the literature of semi-supervised learning,85,100 it is likely to
grow in popularity. Active learning is relatively new; it is based
around iterative data acquisition guided by Bayesian optimization.101 Active learning is especially notable in how it utilizes a
very small starting dataset (initial data can be as small as 10 samples), and guides data acquisition to obtain a desired outcome
much faster than random sampling.102 Active learning has been
applied to discover redoxmers with a speciﬁc desired reduction
potential,86 high-glass-transition polymers,82,103 ring polymer
molecular dynamics104 and epoxy adhesive strength,105 among
others. Active learning will become increasingly important and
valuable, especially as high-throughput and robotic synthesis
approaches are developed.

CONCLUSIONS
Moving forward, polymer informatics will be central to the genesis of new materials. As we design materials to solve increasingly
difﬁcult problems, we need data-driven design to make the most
use of available knowledge. One of the greatest challenges in
polymer design is developing polymers that need multiple properties optimized. Multi-property design (Fig. 1), especially when
one of the properties is degradation behavior or recyclability, is
increasingly necessary, and very difﬁcult to do well, as maximizing
one property often requires tradeoffs in other properties. Additional key challenges for polymer informatics include the need
for polymer representations that capture stochasticity, larger
datasets and more research into retrosynthetic design
approaches.77,78,99 An informatics-driven approach allows quantiﬁcation of tradeoffs and expands the pool of possible materials,
working from an inverse design approach. Whether it is designing
a polymer that includes triggered deconstruction, one that
responds to changing conditions, or is suitable for an extreme
environment, data-driven approaches can shorten design cycles
and open new avenues of research.
