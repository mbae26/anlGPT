Accurate quantum chemical energies for 133 000
organic molecules†

The energies of the 133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of
theory and then were used to calculate their enthalpies of formation. This database contains organic
molecules having nine or less atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and ﬂuorine, as well as hydrogen
atoms. The accuracy of the G4MP2 energies was investigated on a subset of 459 of the molecules
having experimental enthalpies of formation with small uncertainties. On this subset the G4MP2
enthalpies of formation have an accuracy of 0.79 kcal mol1, which is similar to its accuracy previously
reported for the smaller G3/05 test set. An error analysis of the theoretical enthalpies of formation of the
459 molecules is presented in terms of the size and type of the molecules. Three diﬀerent density
functionals (B3LYP, uB97X-D, M06-2X) were also assessed on 459 molecules of accurate enthalpy data
for comparison with the G4MP2 results. The G4MP2 energies for the 133 K molecules provide a database

Introduction

Knowledge of thermochemical data of molecules is very
important in many areas of science. Thermochemical data
provide the information needed to determine stabilities and
reactivities of molecules present in combustion, battery electrolytes, drugs, the atmosphere, catalysis, etc. It is especially
important that the thermochemical data for molecules be of
chemical accuracy (<1 kcal mol1) for such applications.
Composite quantum chemical methods have been developed
that can give molecular energies accurate to better than
1 kcal mol1. This includes methods such as the Gn theory,1–4
the Complete Basis Set (CBS) methods,5–7 the correlation
consistent Composite Approaches (ccCA),8–10 the multicoeﬃcient correlation methods (MCCMs),11–13 Weizmann (Wn)
methods,14–17 and the Wuhan-Minnesota scaling WMS
method.18 In addition, accuracies of as small as 0.1 kcal mol1
can be obtained for small molecules using much more expensive and elaborate methods.19–21 While density functional
methods are faster, even the latest methods have not yet
reached an accuracy of better than 1 kcal mol1.22,23 With the
power of today's computers and using quantum chemical

methods capable of 1 kcal mol1 accuracy it is now possible to
predict energies of tens of thousands of molecules that can
provide a database for calculating millions of reaction energies.
Such a database of energies can also provide information to
assess the accuracy of experimental data on enthalpies of
formation of molecules in the literature, many of which have
signicant uncertainties.
In this paper we report on the calculation of the energies of
133 296 molecules in the GDB-9 database24 using the G4MP2
method1 with the goal of providing accurate data for these
molecules to use in calculating reaction energies and assessing
existing enthalpies of formation. In addition, the accurate
energies of these molecules can provide the data needed for
development of low cost machine learning methods for predicting much larger sets of molecular energies. The GDB-9 data
base contains all molecules of up to nine heavy atoms of the
rst row (C, N, O, F) and hydrogens. The G4MP2 method has an
accuracy of better than 1 kcal mol1 (ref. 1) based on the G3/05
test set, which has a limited number of large molecules.25 We
used a small subset of the GDB-9 molecules that have very
accurate experimental enthalpies of formation to ensure that
the G4MP2 method maintains its accuracy on the larger molecules in the GDB-9 dataset. This subset also provides an
opportunity to assess the accuracy of some popular density
functional methods for thermochemical data of larger molecules, which has not previously been done extensively for larger
molecules. The G4MP2 energies are used to calculate reaction
energies for ve diﬀerent types of reactions to illustrate how the

database of energies can be used to calculate a range of accurate
reaction energies. In Section II we describe the database and
molecular notation used as well as the quantum chemical
methods. In Section III analysis of the errors in enthalpies of
formation of a subset of the molecules with accurate experimental data is presented for G4MP2 theory as well as for three
widely used density functional methods. In Section IV the
calculation of a selection of reaction energies from the database
is presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V.

II.

Methods

The computations of the enthalpies of formation of the molecules in the GDB-9 database were carried out with the G4MP2
method.1 G4MP2 is a composite method based on G4 theory,2
but with reduced perturbation theory levels to lower the
computational cost. More specically, in the G4MP2 method
second-order perturbation theory is used in place of the time
consuming fourth-order perturbation theory components in the
G4 method. As a result the G4MP2 method is approximately six
to eight times faster than the G4 method.1 Other parts of the
method remain the same as in G4 theory including the CCSD(T)
component, geometries, and zero-point energies. It was
assessed on the G3/05 test set of accurate experimental data and
found to have a mean absolute deviation of 1.04 kcal mol1 for
454 enthalpies of formation, ionization potentials, electron
aﬃnities, and proton aﬃnities. For the 138 hydrocarbons and
substituted hydrocarbons in the G3/05 test set the mean absolute deviation was 0.77 kcal mol1. In order to better assess the
likely accuracy of G4MP2 for the GDB-9 database of 133 296
molecules we have selected 459 molecules from the Pedley
compilation26 that have very accurate (<1 kcal mol1) gas phase
enthalpies of formation. More details on this test set and how it
was selected is given in the next section. All calculations were
carried out with the Gaussian code.27
In addition, we have carried out density functional calculations on these 459 molecules with three density functional
methods. The B3LYP28 density functional results on these
molecules were included in this study because they are part of
the G4MP2 calculation with B3LYP being used for the geometry
optimizations. Since the development of the hybrid GGA B3LYP
functional, numerous other functionals with better performance have been reported.22,23 We chose two other popular
functionals to assess on the 459 molecules, namely, M06-2X,29
a hybrid meta-GGA functional, and uB97X-D,30 a GGA functional with dispersion correction. The 6-31G(2df,p) basis set
used for the B3LYP functional, while the 6-311+G(3df,2p) basis
(at B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) geometries) is used for the M06-2X and
uB97X-D functionals. A smaller basis set was used for B3LYP as
it gives better results than the larger basis set. It has been noted
previously that improvement in the basis sets does not always
lead to improvement in results as is the case with wave function
based methods.25 It has been suggested that this is due to
cancelation of errors from an overestimation of the basis set
superposition error that compensates for the lack of a dispersion correction.31

We performed G4MP2 calculations for 133 296 molecules
belonging to the GDB-9 database24,32 containing varying
amounts of C, H, O, N, and F atoms; as aforementioned, the
maximum number of non-hydrogen (heavy) atoms in any
molecule in this database is 9. The molecules with 9 nonhydrogen atoms dominate the database, comprising 83% of
the molecules (i.e., 111 128) in the GDB-9 database as shown in
Table 1; in comparison, there are only 3 molecules with one
heavy atom, namely CH4, NH3, and H2O. This is expected, owing
to the large number of elemental combinations, and isomers
possible for molecules made-up of 9 heavy atoms. In terms of
molecule types, those made up exclusively of H, C, O and N
atoms (listed as HCON) are most prominent (50%), followed
by HCO (34%). For each molecule in the GDB-9 dataset, we
adopted the DFT-relaxed (using the B3LYP functional) congurations from ref. 24 and 32 to perform calculations at the
G4MP2 level of theory. We found that 581 molecules out of the
133 877 molecules in the original GDB-9 database (refs) show
imaginary modes of vibration; these molecules are discarded
from this study. For the remaining 133 296 molecules, we
computed zero-point energies, energies (at 0 K), enthalpies, free
energies, standard enthalpies of formation, and atomization
energies. The G4MP2 values, and atomic coordinates of all the
molecules are stored within an Atomic Simulation Environment
(ASE) database33 compatible with JSON and SQLite3 backends.
The molecules and their corresponding G4MP2 data are all
cross-indexed by their chemical formula, SMILES, and InChI
keys. This makes it straightforward to retrieve G4MP2 for a class
of compounds, isomers, or specic molecule from this database
using a Python script (an example Python script to retrieve data
is provided in the ESI†). Furthermore, the use of such a database enables fast/eﬃcient search for data (on-demand) necessary for various machine-learning studies.

III. Assessment of expected accuracy
of G4MP2 for the GDB-9 database
In order to assess the accuracy of the G4MP2 method for the
GDB-9 database we selected all molecules from the database
that had an experimental value in the Pedley compilation26 with
an uncertainty of less than 1 kcal mol1. This resulted in a total
of 510 molecules. Comparing the G4MP2 and experimental
values we found a number of values in disagreement by
substantially more than 1 kcal mol1. In order to ensure that we
had a reasonably accurate experimental test set we examined
more closely all experimental values that diﬀered by more than
2.50 kcal mol1 with G4MP2, of which there were 63. We then
checked to see if there were any other recent experimental
values that conicted with the Pedley values. In 12 cases (see
ESI†) there were other values that diﬀered by more than
1 kcal mol1, the quoted uncertainty of the Pedley value. In
those cases we eliminated them from the test set as we could
not verify their accuracy. That le 51 cases of diﬀerences greater
than 2.5 kcal mol1. In those cases we used an isodesmic
scheme34 to evaluate the questionable experimental values. The
isodesmic scheme is one previously developed using G2MP2

molecules. This isodesmic scheme was found to give enthalpies
of formation accurate to 0.5 kcal mol1.34 We eliminated 39
molecules from the test set based on the criterion that the
suspect experimental value diﬀered by more than 2 kcal mol1
from the G2MP2 isodesmic enthalpy of formation. These
experimental enthalpies of formation will be the subject of
further high level quantum chemical calculations. The
remaining 12 with diﬀerences greater than 2.50 kcal mol1 were
kept in the test set as there was no basis to discard them. The
resulting test set, referred to as the Pedley test set, has 459
molecules including 175 hydrocarbons and 284 substituted
hydrocarbons. We note that we have selected this test set for
assessing the accuracy of G4MP2 on the organic molecules as
opposed to others that are available35,36 because it is based on
experimental numbers from a compilation, all of which have
a quoted uncertainty. About 92 of the 459 molecules are
included in the G3/05 test set, which also included molecules
containing S and Cl as well as some larger systems.
The Pedley test set of 459 enthalpies of formation is given in
Table S2 of the ESI.† Also given in the table are the G4MP2
calculated enthalpies of formation and the experimental
enthalpies of formation along with the diﬀerences between the
two. Table 2 gives a summary of the results in terms of mean
absolute deviations (MAD) between experimental values and the
G4MP2 values. The MAD between experiment and G4MP2 for
the Pedley test set is 0.79 kcal mol1, which is comparable to
MAD of 0.77 kcal mol1 of the smaller G3/05 test set of similar
type molecules. The breakdown in terms of types of molecules
(hydrocarbon and substituted hydrocarbons) is also similar.

Atomization energy as a function of standard enthalpy of formation at 298 K for (a) 133 K molecules in GDB-9 dataset, and (b) 459
molecules in the selected Pedley test set. In each panel, a frequency distribution of atomization energy and standard enthalpy of formation
among the molecules is shown at the top and right margins, respectively.

Fig. 3

Fig. 1 shows the MAD as a function of the number of heavy
atoms (CNOF) in the molecule. This plot shows a gradually
increasing error with size of the molecule for G4MP2. This is
expected and has been found previously for long chain
alkanes.37 The increase in error with size is due to the increase
in the number of electron pairs. In Fig. 2 we have plotted the
error per electron pair as a function of number of heavy atoms.
This shows that the size of the error is quite level with
increasing molecule size. In terms of calculating reaction
energies from G4MP2 enthalpies of formation (see Section IV),
the resulting reaction energies should be quite accurate because
they are based on breaking one or a couple of bonds, whereas
the enthalpies of formation are based on breaking all bonds in
the molecule, i.e. they are calculated from atomization energies
(along with temperature corrections, elemental standard states,
and zero-point energies).38
The Pedley test provides an opportunity to assess the accuracy of some popular density functional methods for thermochemical data of larger molecules. Previous test sets of
thermochemical data used for assessing density functional have
not included as extensive a set of larger molecules as the Pedley
set established for this work. An error analysis on the Pedley test
set was carried out for three popular DFT methods B3LYP,28
M06-2X,29 and uB97X-D.30 The results for these three functionals are given in Table 2 with details for all 459 molecules
given in ESI Tables 3–5.† The uB97X-D functional performs the
best with a mean absolute deviation of 1.85 kcal mol1 for the
459 molecules. M06-2X has an mean absolute deviation of
2.71 kcal mol1. B3LYP has the largest mean absolute deviation
of the three at 3.99 kcal mol1. Thus, even the best functional
tested has a mean absolute deviation of more than twice as large
as G4MP2. Fig. 1 shows the MAD for the three functionals as
a function of the number of heavy atoms (CNOF) in the molecule. The plots show a generally increasing error with size of the
molecule for the three functionals. In Fig. 2 the error per electron pair is plotted as a function of number of heavy atoms,
which shows that the error remains approximately constant as
the molecule size increases with the exception of B3LYP that

are similar to G4MP2.

Web.33 Fig. 3 shows a plot of the atomization energies vs. the
enthalpies of formation that illustrate the distribution of
both types of energies. It is noted that for the 133 K molecules, the enthalpies of formation have a much larger range
of positive values than those of the Pedley test set of 459
molecules while the atomization energies have a similar
range of values. The reason for the diﬀerence in distributions
for the more positive enthalpies of formation is probably
because the GDB-9 set includes some hypothetical molecules
that can be more unstable (i.e., positive enthalpies of
formation). This type of molecule would be hard to synthesize, and thus are not present in the Pedley test set. Otherwise

the Pedley test seems to be a good representation of the GDB9 set.

types of atoms in the molecules are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. In
Fig. 4 the enthalpies of formation of the 130 K organic molecules are classied into various groups of atom types. This
gure indicates that addition of oxygen and uorine to the
molecules generally increases their stability, i.e. they have more
negative enthalpies of formation, whereas addition of nitrogen
has the opposite eﬀect. In Fig. 5 the enthalpies of formation of
CHO type molecules as a function of number of oxygen atoms is

number of oxygens in the molecules generally increases their
stability.
Since the G4MP2 energy calculation also includes the B3LYP/
6-31G(2df,p) method for geometry optimization, we also obtained these energies for the 133 K molecules in the GDB-9
database and they are included in the ESI† on the Web.33 The
mean absolute deviation between these B3LYP energies and the
G4MP2 energies is 4.54 kcal mol1. The breakdown of the mean
absolute deviations for B3LYP with G4MP2 as a function of size
of the molecule and type of molecule is given in ESI Fig. 1.† The
error increases slightly with size of molecule. In addition, the
B3LYP results in this gure indicate that the molecules containing uorine have much larger deviations with G4MP2 than
those not containing uorine.
The database of G4MP2 enthalpies of formation provides
a source of data for the derivation of accurate energies of
millions of reactions involving organic molecules up to nine
heavy atoms. To illustrate this we have calculated some energies
for ve diﬀerent types of reactions from the G4MP2 energies
and tabulate them in Table 3. These include (1) alcohol oxidation, (2) alkane oxidation, (3) ether hydrolysis, (4) hydrogenolysis, and (5) carbonyl reduction. Energies for all of these
types of reactions are expected to be accurate to about
1 kcal mol1 based on the accuracy of the G4MP2 energies. In
addition to the reaction energies that can be derived, the large
database of enthalpies of formation also provides a basis on
which to assess existing or newly measured enthalpies of
formation. The method by which the enthalpies of formation
can be obtained from the database of G4MP2 energies33 is
described in the ESI.†

V. Conclusions
Energies for the 133 000 molecules in the GDB-9 database,
containing organic molecules having nine or less atoms of
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and uorine as well as hydrogen
atoms, have been calculated at the G4MP2 level of theory. The
following conclusions can be drawn from this study:
(1) The accuracy of the G4MP2 energies was investigated on
a subset of 459 of the molecules having experimental enthalpies
of formation with small uncertainties and was found to have an
accuracy of 0.79 kcal mol1, which indicates the G4MP2
enthalpies of formation of the GDB-9 database should have
a similar accuracy.
(2) Three diﬀerent density functionals (B3LYP, uB97X-D,
M06-2X) were also assessed on 459 molecules of accurate
enthalpy data for comparison with the G4MP2 results and the
latter two were found to be much more accurate that B3LYP, but
less accurate than G4MP2.
(3) The G4MP2 energies for the 133 K molecules provide
a database that can be used to calculate accurate reaction
energies as well as to assess new or existing experimental
enthalpies of formation.
The G4MP2 energies of the GDB-9 molecules will also be
useful in future investigations of applications of machine
learning to quantum chemical data by providing a large database of accurate energies for machine learning to develop new
