ABSTRACT: G4MP2 theory has proven to be a reliable and accurate quantum
chemical composite method for the calculation of molecular energies using an
approximation based on second-order perturbation theory to lower computational costs
compared to G4 theory. However, it has been found to have signiﬁcantly increased
errors when applied to larger organic molecules with 10 or more nonhydrogen atoms.
We report here on an investigation of the cause of the failure of G4MP2 theory for such
larger molecules. One source of error is found to be the “higher-level correction
(HLC)”, which is meant to correct for deﬁciencies in correlation contributions to the
calculated energies. This is because the HLC assumes that the contribution is independent of the element and the type of bonding
involved, both of which become more important with larger molecules. We address this problem by adding an atom-speciﬁc
correction, dependent on atom type but not bond type, to the higher-level correction. We ﬁnd that a G4MP2 method that
incorporates this modiﬁcation of the higher-level correction, referred to as G4MP2A, becomes as accurate as G4 theory (for
computing enthalpies of formation) for a test set of molecules with less than 10 nonhydrogen atoms as well as a set with 10−14 such
atoms, the set of molecules considered here, with a much lower computational cost. The G4MP2A method is also found to
signiﬁcantly improve ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities. Finally, we implemented the G4MP2A energies in a machine
learning method to predict molecular energies.

There have also been variations of G4MP2 theory, such as
G4MP2-6X and G4MP2-XK, that have been meant to address
certain types of problems and to extend to other
elements.10−12
In recent work, we have reported on investigations of
quantum chemically informed machine learning for the
prediction of G4MP2 energies of organic molecules. In one
paper, we used quantum chemical energies of a set of 130,258
molecules with 1−9 nonhydrogen atoms13 to train and assess
the performance of several machine learning (ML) methods.14
Two ML methods were used: a kernel-based ridge regression
(FCHL)15 and a continuous ﬁlter convolutional neural
network (SchNet),16 both combined with Δ-learning on the
diﬀerence between the G4MP2 energies and B3LYP energies.
The best-performing ML method was able to predict G4MP2
energies to within 0.1 kcal/mol.14 In a subsequent paper,17 we
examined how the two best-performing ML methods from the
ﬁrst paper performed on molecules larger than the test set of
1−9 nonhydrogen atoms. In addition, in this study, we also

INTRODUCTION
Gaussian-4 (G4)1 theory, the fourth in a series of the Gn
composite methods2 developed to predict molecular energies
to chemical accuracy, has been widely used since it was ﬁrst
developed. It has an accuracy of 0.83 kcal/mol (mean absolute
deviation) for the 454 systems in the G3/05 test set. G4 theory
uses a combination of single-point energies [CCSD(T)/631G(d), MP4/6-31+G(d), MP4/6-31G(2df,p), MP2(FU)/
G3LargeXP, and HF limit] at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)
geometry and an empirical higher-level correction (HLC) to
achieve this accuracy. A major limitation of G4 theory is the
large increase in computational resources required as the
molecules become larger, due to the MP4 calculations. To
lower computational costs, the G4MP2 method was developed
in which the fourth-order perturbation components of G4
theory3 are replaced with reduced perturbation theory levels.
G4MP2 is approximately 6−8 times faster than G4.3 While this
increase in speed comes with some loss of accuracy, with the
mean absolute deviation for the G3/05 test set increasing to
1.03 kcal/mol, G4MP2 has been widely used.
G4 theory is one of a number of accurate quantum chemical
methods that have been developed for predicting molecular
energies to better than 1 kcal/mol accuracy. Other methods
include the correlation consistent Composite Approach

assessed the suitability of the ωB97XD density functional
method for learning. To have accurate enthalpies of formation
for molecules with 10 to 14 nonhydrogen atoms, we derived
accurate experimental data for a set of 191 molecules. The
better-performing ML method investigated in the second
paper, FCHL-Δ, gave atomization energies for these 191
organic molecules within about 0.4 kcal/mol of accurate
quantum chemical energies calculated by the G4MP2 method.
Although this level of accuracy is less than that obtained with
FCHL-Δ for a hold-out set of the smaller molecules (0.1 kcal/
mol), it demonstrated that quantum chemically informed ML
can be used to successfully predict energies of large organic
molecules with sizes beyond those in the training set at a much
lower cost in computer time.
Another result in ref 17 was that analysis of G4MP2
enthalpies of formation of the 191 molecules with 10−14
nonhydrogen atoms revealed that the G4MP2 method is
signiﬁcantly less accurate for these larger molecules than it is
for the set of smaller organic molecules with 1−9 nonhydrogen
atoms. Compared to accurate experimental data, the G4MP2
method had a mean absolute deviation of 1.41 kcal/mol for the
molecules with 10−14 nonhydrogen atoms, which was
dramatically larger than the 0.79 kcal/mol for 459 organic
molecules having 1−9 nonhydrogen atoms. From an analysis
of the molecules having large errors in the set of 191
molecules, it was found that G4MP2 does especially poorly for
large aromatic molecules and for molecules with multiple
nitrogen atoms. In addition, G4 theory was investigated for a
subset of 54 aromatic molecules of the 10−14 nonhydrogen set
and was found to do considerably better (mean absolute
deviation of 1.15 kcal/mol compared to 1.84 kcal/mol for the
same set with G4MP2).
The objectives of the work reported in this paper were to
determine the cause of the failure of the G4MP2 theory for the
larger molecules identiﬁed in ref 17 and to investigate remedies
for the problem. One source of error investigated was the
higher-level correction, which is meant to correct for
deﬁciencies in correlation contributions to the molecular
energies. One problem for this approximation is that it assumes
that the contribution is independent of the element and the
type of bonding involved. This approximation seems to be a
problem that becomes worse in larger molecules, which may
have types of molecules not present in the sets of smaller
molecules on which G4MP2 performs well. To address this
problem, we have added an atom-speciﬁc correction to the
HLC. Importantly, this correction is dependent only on the
type of atom, not on the bond type, as the latter would make
implementation diﬃcult. With this simple addition to the
HLC, we ﬁnd that the G4MP2 method, referred to as
G4MP2A, becomes as accurate as G4 theory, with a much
smaller cost. We also added this type of modiﬁcation to the G4
method, referred to as G4A, but found little improvement. The
G4MP2A method is also found to do better than G4MP2 for
ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities. The G4MP2A
method has been implemented in the ML learning method
previously reported for G4MP2. This implementation
improves the ML-predicted energies considerably because
they are now trained on data with G4-like rather than G4MP2
accuracy.
In the Methods section, we describe the theoretical methods
and test sets used in this paper. In the Results and Discussion
section, we report on how the new parameterization performs
for enthalpies, ionization potentials, and electron aﬃnities, as

well as an analysis of the results. In this section, we also
describe the new ML results for the G4MP2A method.

METHODS
The energies of the molecules and ions considered in this work
were calculated using the composite G4MP2 method.3 Some
results for the G4 method1 are included for comparison, and a
similar procedure is used. In the G4MP2 method, a higherlevel correction (HLC) is added on to the series of calculations
to account for remaining deﬁciencies in the energies. The HLC
has six parameters. The HLC includes corrections for the
number of pairs of electrons in closed-shell molecules (or
ions), the number of pairs of electrons and unpaired electrons
in open-shell molecules (or ions), and the number of pairs of
electrons and unpaired electrons in atoms and atomic ions.
There is also a correction for the energy of a pair of electrons
in molecular and atomic nonhydrogen species having only one
pair of valence electrons.
In the current work, we have added an “atom-speciﬁc
correction”, i.e., a correction that is speciﬁc to the number of
each type of atom in the molecule or ion, that increases or
decreases the atomic energies to minimize the mean absolute
deviation with respect to experiment for the test sets as
described below. The atom-speciﬁc correction is similar to a
method proposed by Perdew et al.18 for improving several
density functional methods. The new G4MP2 method with
atom-speciﬁc corrections is referred to as G4MP2A. Details of
the atom-speciﬁc corrections and results using the new method
are given in the next section. The G4MP2 and G4 methods as
implemented within the Gaussian 16 package are used with the
standard settings.19 In addition, we determined atom-speciﬁc
parameters for B3LYP20,21 and ωB97XD22 for enthalpies in a
similar manner. The B3LYP study was done with the 631G(2df,p) basis, and the ωB97XD study was done with the 6311+G(3df,2p) basis as in our previous study.17
We used a set of 681 neutral enthalpies of formation to
optimize the atom-speciﬁc parameters. This set is composed of
the 222 ﬁrst- and second-row molecules from the G3/99 test
set23 and the 459 ﬁrst-row molecules of the Pedley test set13
(referred to as the PDS(9)) composed of 1−9 nonhydrogen
atoms. The PDS(9) test set includes experimental data for 175
hydrocarbons and 284 substituted hydrocarbons from
experimental data in the Pedley compilation24 that was
critically evaluated.13
We also used a set of larger molecules with 10−14
nonhydrogen atoms, referred to as the PDS(10−14) test
set,17 to assess how well the new methods based on atomspeciﬁc correction perform on larger molecules than in the
original set. The larger molecules include 71 hydrocarbons and
120 substituted hydrocarbons. The PDS(10−14) test set17 was
derived from experimental data for molecules with 10−14
nonhydrogen atoms in the Pedley compilation.24 The
experimental data was checked by an isodesmic scheme25
that eliminated 34 of 225 molecules to get to the 191
molecules.24 We have computed standard enthalpies of
formation at 298 K using methods described previously.26,27
Some G4MP2A energies still had large errors for the PDS(10−
14) set even after application of the isodesmic scheme and
these were investigated for possible incorrect conformers as
described in the next section. Six molecules were further
eliminated after this process (see below).

The electron aﬃnities and ionization potentials used to
derive atom-speciﬁc corrections come from the G3/99 test set.
This test set has 88 ionization potentials and 58 electron
aﬃnities of ﬁrst- and second-row molecules that were used in
this study. The ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities for
this study were calculated as described previously.23

corrections could be subtracted from the molecule energy. The
higher-level corrections used for G4MP2A are the same as
those used in G4MP4; they are also given in Table 1. The

where EASC(G4A,X) is the atomic-speciﬁc correction and
Ee(G4,X) is the G4 energy of element X calculated as
described in ref 1. The EASC(G4A,X) parameters were
optimized to give the smallest mean absolute deviation for
G4A enthalpies of formation compared to the experiment for
the 681 molecules in the G3/99 and PDS(9) test sets, which
are described in the Methods section. The G4A enthalpies are
calculated from G4 energies1 of the molecules and atomic
energies corrected as in eq 2. The values of these corrections
are given in Table 1. The higher-level corrections used for G4A
are the same as G4 and are also given in Table 1.
The results for the modiﬁed G4MP2 and G4 methods with
atom-speciﬁc corrections added, G4MP2A and G4A, are given
in Table 2. These results include the performance on the G3/
99 test set of 222 enthalpies of formation and the PDS(9) test
set of 459 enthalpies of formation. We note that the addition of
the ASC parameter to G4 theory has a modest eﬀect, only
slightly decreasing the overall mean absolute deviation (MAD)
for both test sets with respect to experiment from 0.73 to 0.71
kcal/mol. The decrease for the individual test sets is similar:
0.73 to 0.71 kcal/mol for the G3/99 test set and 0.74 to 0.72
kcal/mol for the PDS(9) test set. In contrast, a much larger
improvement is seen when the ASC parameters are added to
the G4MP2 method. The addition of the ASC parameter to
G4MP2 decreases the overall MAD with respect to the
experiment from 0.84 to 0.70 kcal/mol. The decrease is from
0.93 to 0.71 kcal/mol for the G3/99 test set and from 0.79 to
0.69 kcal/mol for the PDS(9) test set. The breakdown of the
results in the types of molecules is also given in Table 2. For
the G3/99 test set, the G4MP2A improvement occurs for all
categories of molecules. For the PDS(9) test set, the largest
improvement occurs for hydrocarbons (0.68 to 0.52 kcal/mol),
although substituted hydrocarbons (0.86 to 0.81 kcal/mol) are
also improved. The key result for the ASC parameterization is
that its inclusion in the G4MP2 energies gives an overall
accuracy for enthalpies of formation that is about the same as
G4 theory for the combined test set of 681 molecules, i.e., 0.70
kcal/mol, while requiring much less computer time.
The optimization of the ASC parameters was also done
without the HLC parameterization. For G4, the MAD
increases to 0.77 kcal/mol (from 0.71 kcal/mol), and for
G4MP2, it increases only to 0.72 kcal/mol (from 0.70 kcal/
mol), both of these results being for the combined test set of
681 molecules. Thus, G4MP2A could be formulated without
an HLC with essentially the same results. For this study, we
have included the HLC in G4MP2A, to avoid any change in
the basic method.
While the G4MP2A method also gave some improvement
for the larger molecules of the PDS(10−14) set compared to
G4MP2 from our previous study,3 we observed that some of

where EASC(G4MP2A,X) is the atomic-speciﬁc correction
(ASC) to an atomic energy of element X and Ee(G4MP2,X)
is the G4MP2 energy of element X calculated as described in
ref 3. The EASC(G4MP2A,X) corrections have been optimized
to give the smallest mean absolute deviation for G4MP2A
enthalpies of formation compared to the experiment for the
681 molecules in the G3/99 and PDS(9) test sets, which are
described in the Methods section. The G4MP2A enthalpies are
calculated from G4MP4 energies3 of the molecules and atomic
energies corrected as in eq 1. The values of the corrections are
given in Table 1 for the elements H, B−F, and Al−Cl. (The
ASC parameters are not used for Li, Be, Na, and Mg due to the
lack of data for molecules containing these elements in the test
sets.) For example, for the ethane atomization energy, the
corrections would be as follows

are taken to be the same as those for G4 and G4MP2. bThe ASC

G4MP2 results for G3/99 are from ref 2, for PDS(9) are from ref 13, and for PDS(10−14) are from ref 17 (but updated for the elimination of 6
molecules and new geometries, see text). G4 results for G3/99 are from ref 2. The G4 results for PDS(9) are from this work. The G4 PDS(10−14)
aromatics are from ref 17 (but updated for new geometries, see text). The COF2 molecules were not included in the G3/99 results due to a large
experimental error.23 bAtom-speciﬁc correction parameters optimized for the combined set of 681 enthalpies of neutral molecules in the G3/99 and
PDS(9) test sets as described in the text. cOptimization of the atom-speciﬁc correction parameters with no higher-level correction (HLC) gives

parentheses are for max deviations. fFor 54 of the 87 aromatic molecules in the PDS(10−14) test set.

PDS(10−14) molecules computed with the G4MP2 and
G4MP2A methods. The standard enthalpies of formation for
the 185 molecules at the G4MP2A level of theory using the
updated molecules along with their experimental values are
given in Table S1. This table also shows the deviations for both
the G4MP2A and G4MP2 methods from experiment for the
185 molecules. Additionally, deviations in standard enthalpies
of the six eliminated molecules are given in Table S2. In Table
2, the overall MAD of G4MP2 of 1.43 kcal/mol, relative to
experimental values, decreases to 0.96 kcal/mol for the
G4MP2A method. Among the 185 molecules, there are 68
hydrocarbons and 117 substituted hydrocarbons. The MAD of
the 71 hydrocarbons decreases dramatically from 1.80 kcal/
mol for G4MP2 to 0.93 kcal/mol for the new G4MP2A
method. The MADs of the substituted hydrocarbons also
decrease, to 1.20 kcal/mol for G4MP2 and to 0.98 kcal/mol
and G4MP2A.
The G4MP2 and G4MP2A MADs for the molecules in the
PDS(9) and PD(10−14) datasets as a function of size are
given in Table 3. The dramatic improvement in the G4MP2A
energies compared to G4MP2 for molecules with 10−14
nonhydrogen atoms is illustrated in Figure 1. When the
comparison is made on a per electron pair basis as a function of
nonhydrogen atoms in Figure 2, G4MP2A also shows a
signiﬁcant improvement over G4MP2 for the molecule set with
10−14 nonhydrogen atoms. In addition, we have performed
computations with G4 theory for a limited set of the larger
molecules in the 185 PDS(10−14) set, to enable comparison
with G4MP2A. This set includes the 54 aromatic molecules in
the PDS(10−14) set. The results in Table 2 show that for
G4MP2, the error is reduced from 1.93 to 1.07 kcal/mol for
this set of molecules, which is actually better than the G4 result
(1.16 kcal/mol). We note that the set of data used to optimize
the atomic correction parameters did not include the

the molecules still performed poorly. We identiﬁed one
possible cause of this to be that the structure that we used
in the previous study was not the lowest-energy conformer.
Due to the large number of potential conformers of the larger
molecules in this test set, locating the lowest-energy conformer
is more diﬃcult using traditional geometry optimization
techniques. As a result, we used an advanced sampling
technique to search for other more stable conformers of
these molecules based on G4MP2 energies. For this purpose,
we used the CREST (Conformer−Rotamer Ensemble
Sampling Tool) utility program28 to perform conformational
searches on the previously published PDS(10−14) set of
geometries as a starting point.17 When performing these
conformational searches, referred to as Method-1, we
optimized the resultant conformers using the GFN2-xTB
method29,30 and then selected the lowest-energy conformer for
carrying out a new G4MP2 energy calculation. Although it
provided lower-energy conformers for some of the molecules,
we still had cases where some previously published17
conformers were more stable than those found by the
CREST program. Thus, we also performed CREST starting
from SMILES strings, referred to as Method-2. However, even
this method did not always provide the lowest-energy
conformers. Overall, we updated our previously published
PDS(10−14) set of molecules containing 191 species with new
geometries when Method-1 or Method-2 gave the lowest
energies based on comparing G4MP2 energies. With this
improved set of geometries, we then eliminated six molecules
out of 191, based on isodesmic reactions performed on the
resultant geometries. The isodesmic evaluation was done
similarly to our previous study.25 The new geometries of the
185 are given in an Excel spreadsheet in the Supplemental
Information.

PDS(10−14) set of 185 molecules, indicating that the
parameters should be valid for larger molecules.
The gradual increase in error with molecule size in Figure 1
for G4MP2A is probably due to the accumulation of error with
the number of atoms in the molecule, not any inherent
problem with the methodology. We found that the MAD for
the enthalpies of formation for the 87 aromatic molecules in
the PDS(10−14) set is 1.92 kcal/mol. In contrast, the MAD
for the remaining 98 (nonaromatic) molecules is 0.99 kcal/mol
(almost one-half compared to the MAD of aromatic
molecules). The signed error per carbon atom increases from
1.08 kcal/mol for 6 carbon atoms to 3.04 kcal/mol for 14
carbon atoms in the aromatic molecules in PDS(10−14). The
results for all 87 molecules as a function of the number of
carbon atoms in the molecule are shown in Figure 3, and the
results are in Table 4. The results show a signiﬁcant increase in
errors on G4MP2 energies with an increase in the number of
carbon atoms for the 87 of PDS(10−14) aromatic molecules.
However, there is no such eﬀect in the case of the G4MP2A
enthalpies. Thus, it is apparent that the higher-level corrections
(HLC) used in G4MP2 do not do very well for aromatics.
However, in the case of G4, for similarly obtained HLCs, the
MADs are much better because G4 has less approximations
than G4MP2. The average error per nonhydrogen atom in the
molecule, shown in Table 3, is quite constant with increasing
molecule size, a result consistent with an accumulation of error.
For G4MP2A, only 16 of the 185 molecules in Table S1 have
errors of 2 kcal/mol or more (only two of which are slightly
greater than 3 kcal/mol). Of the 16, these are distributed as
follows: 11 are substituted or multiple aromatic rings, three are
substituted alkyl or ether chain molecules, and two are multiple
aliphatic rings. In comparison, the G4MP2 method does much
worse, with 40 out of the 185 having errors of 2 kcal/mol or
more, and one-half of those greater than 3 kcal/mol.
Table 5 gives the G4MP2A results, i.e., results for the
inclusion of atom-speciﬁc corrections in the G4MP2 method,
for the calculation of ionization potentials and electron
aﬃnities in the G33 test set. The atomic-speciﬁc corrections
for anions and cations are optimized in the same way as for the

dataset grouped based on the number of carbon atoms in a molecule for the G4MP2 and G4MP2A methods. Data from Table 4.

enthalpies of neutrals, the results in Table 5 indicate that the
G4MP2A method has an accuracy comparable to full G4
theory for ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities.
We also investigated the use of atom-speciﬁc corrections
with two density functional methods to see if they provide
signiﬁcant improvement. The two methods used are the
B3LYP and ωB97xd functionals, as described in the Methods
section; results are given in Table 6. For both functionals, the
atom-speciﬁc corrections were optimized to give the smallest
mean absolute deviation for enthalpies of formation compared
to experiment for the 681 molecules in the G3/99 and PDS(9)
test sets as described in the Methods section for G4MP2A.
The results in Table 6 indicate that the use of the atomicspeciﬁc corrections signiﬁcantly improves the MADs for both
functionals. For B3LYP, the improvement is from 4.16 to 2.36
kcal/mol, and for ωB97XD, the improvement is from 1.92 to
1.48 kcal/mol. The improvement for B3LYP is better than that
for ωB97XD, possibly because there is more room for
improvement. The ωB97XD functional is still signiﬁcantly
better than B3LYP for enthalpies. The use of atom-speciﬁc
corrections for DFT calculations of ionization potentials and
electron aﬃnities will be reported on in another publication.
Machine Learning Based on Methods with AtomSpeciﬁc Corrections. We have previously investigated
various ML methods for predicting enthalpies of formation
of neutral molecules.14,17 The best-performing method was
based on an FCHL-Δ ML approach. The FCHL method is
based on the Kernel−Ridge regression model.15 In this model,
molecular properties are learned using a many-body expansion
distribution of the local environment. Each atom of a molecule
is represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian distributions.
The approach measures the distance between molecules by
summing the distances between each atom in the two
molecules. The distance between two atomic environments is
measured using a weighted sum of the distances between each
many-body expansion, based on geometries and local chemical
environment. The FCHL-Δ approach is a variant of FCHL in
that it learns the diﬀerence between properties computed with
high- and low-ﬁdelity quantum chemical methods on a training
set of molecules.
In this paper, we trained the FCHL-Δ model using the
diﬀerence between G4MP2A and two density functional
methods (B3LYP and ωB97XD) for atomization energies.
The training sets were derived from the previously published

parameters are given in Table S4. For example, for the NH3

Table 5, the G4MP2A MAD for the 69 ionization potentials in
the G33 test set is 0.79 eV, a signiﬁcant improvement over 0.93
eV for G4MP2. Similarly, the G4MP2A MAD for the 47
electron aﬃnities in the G33 test set is 0.83 eV, a signiﬁcant
improvement over 1.04 eV for G4MP2. Similar to the case for

The B3LYP and ωB97XD results are from the references in the footnote a of Table 2. bThe atom-speciﬁc correction is optimized on both G33/99

energies for 133 K molecules at the G4MP2 and B3LYP/631G(2df) levels of theory.13 For G4MP2A, these energies were
modiﬁed by the atom-speciﬁc corrections derived from the set
of 681 molecules as described above. The FCHL-Δ model was
used with these G4MP2A and B3LYP energies and is referred
to as ML-B3LYP-A. We expect this use of the improved
G4MP2A energies to result in the FCHL-Δ trained ML
models achieving energy accuracies close to those of “G4”,
rather than “G4MP2”, since G4MP2A has approximately the
same accuracy as G4 theory, as shown in the last section. In
addition, we have also trained the FCHL-Δ model using the
diﬀerence between G4MP2A and ωB97XD atomization
energies for comparison with results using B3LYP. This
method is referred to as ML-ωB97XD-A. The FCHL-Δ
trained ML models used in this work are available on
DLHub31 and the scripts used to perform parameter
optimization and their outputs are posted to GitHub.32
The ML results for calculations of enthalpies of formation
are summarized in Table 7. In the FCHL-Δ trained ML model
for which results are shown in Table 7, we used a training set
of 10,000 molecules taken from 13,026 molecules selected
randomly from the GDB-9 set of 133 K molecules. The MLB3LYP-A model gave a small MAD of 0.11 kcal/mol between
the ML-predicted energies and the G4MP2A energies. This
was based on the hold-out set (10%) of 1302 molecules from
the pool of 13,026. The ML-ωB97XD-A model gave a slightly
smaller MAD of 0.09 kcal/mol between the ML-predicted
energies and the G4MP2A energies. For both the ML-B3LYPA and ML-ωB97XD-A methods, the use of G4MP2 without
atom-speciﬁc corrections (ML-B3LYP and ML-ωB97XD in
Table 7) gave the same MADs as G4MP2A with atom-speciﬁc
corrections. In addition, the use of B3LYP or ωB97XD with
atomic-speciﬁc corrections gave no improvement (Table 7).
Overall, we ﬁnd that the predicted energies from ML-B3LYP-A
and ML-ωB97XD-A based on G4MP2A energies are more
accurate than ML-B3LYP and ML-ωB97XD since the MADs
of the former are with respect to G4MPA energies instead of
G4MP2.
Table 7 also gives the results for the 185 larger molecules of
the PDS(10−14) dataset using the same methods described

molecules with a deviation of 1 kcal/mol or more. Of these,
ﬁve were over 2 kcal/mol: 1,4-dinitrosopiperazine, di-tertbutyldiazene, N,N,N′,N′-tetraﬂuoro-1,1-heptanediamine, tertbutylperoxide, and trinitromethane. The ML-ωB97XD-A
model had eight with errors over 1 kcal/mol, of which only
two were over 2 kcal/mol: 1,4-dinitropiperazine and
pentaﬂuoropropanoic acid methyl ester. A likely reason for
the larger MADs seen for the listed molecules is the inclusion
of new bonding types that are not present in the set of
molecules with nine nonhydrogen atoms. For example, the
molecules with larger errors noted above include ones with
multiple nitro groups or many ﬂuorines, which are molecular
types that are not included in the smaller molecule set. In
future work, we will investigate how to improve the ML
models to make them less dependent on molecule size.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we investigated the cause of the increase in error
in G4MP2 theory when applied to larger organic molecules
with 10 or more nonhydrogen atoms. The following
conclusions can be drawn from this study:
(1) A key source of error is found to be the “higher-level
correction”, which is meant to correct for deﬁciencies in
correlation contributions to the energies. The problem is
that the higher-level correction is assumed to be
independent of the element and the type of bonding
involved.
(2) To address this problem, we have added an atomspeciﬁc correction to the higher-level correction, which
is only dependent on the type of atom, not on the bond
type. With this simple addition to the higher-level
correction, we ﬁnd that a modiﬁed G4MP2 method,
referred to as G4MP2A, is as accurate as G4 theory for
the set of molecules considered here, with a much
smaller computational cost. Upon addition of this
correction, the G4MP2 MAD is reduced from 0.84 to
0.70 kcal/mol for the 681 molecules with up nine
nonhydrogen molecules and from 1.43 to 0.96 kcal/mol
for the 185 molecules with 10−14 nonhydrogen atoms.
(3) The G4MP2A method is also more accurate in
predicting ionization potentials and electron aﬃnities
of molecules. The G4MP2 MAD is improved from 0.93
to 0.79 eV for ionization potentials and from 1.05 to
0.83 for electron aﬃnities.
(4) Finally, we have implemented the G4MP2A energies in a
Δ-learning ML method that, when trained on density
functional and G4MP2A energies, is shown to predict
molecular energies with improved accuracy with respect
to experiment than comparable ML methods based on
G4MP2 reported previously.17 However, it is found that
extension to larger molecules than in the training set
results in an increase in error, especially for larger
molecules with new bonding types.
