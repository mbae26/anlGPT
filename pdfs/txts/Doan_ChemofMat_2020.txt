ABSTRACT: We employed density functional theory (DFT) to
compute oxidation potentials of 1400 homobenzylic ether molecules
to search for the ideal sustainable redoxmer design. The generated data
were used to construct an active learning model based on Bayesian
optimization (BO) that targets candidates with desired oxidation
potentials utilizing only a minimal number of DFT calculations. The
active learning model demonstrated not only signiﬁcant eﬃciency
improvement over the random selection approach but also robust
capability in identifying desired candidates in an untested set of 112 000
homobenzylic ether molecules. Our ﬁndings highlight the eﬃcacy of
quantum chemistry-informed active learning to accelerate the discovery
of materials with desired properties from a vast chemical space.

INTRODUCTION
Redox ﬂow batteries (RFBs) are a promising technology for
stationary energy storage applications.1−4 Among the technical
challenges associated with nonaqueous redox ﬂow batteries
(NRFBs) is their inability to achieve both a long calendar life
and a long cycle life. Mechanisms of calendar aging mainly
involve the formation of passivating ﬁlms on positive and
negative electrodes.5,6 These ﬁlms interfere with charge
transfer processes at the electrolyte/electrode interfaces.7
One likely cause of ﬁlm formation is the irreversible adsorption
of damaged redoxmers. To regenerate electrode interfaces and
retain long-lifetime NRFBs, we seek to develop redoxmers that
are capable of programmed destruction, thereby providing a
means to remove undesirable ﬁlm deposits. We envisioned a
design concept in which redox-active cores are connected to a
molecular scaﬀold via a cleavable tether. By using a redoxtriggered cleavage reaction, the recreation of a pristine interface
becomes possible simply by altering the electrode’s potential to
a value that is outside the battery’s normal window of
operation.
Mesolytic cleavage reactions are thermodynamically favorable bond dissociation processes that fragment a molecule into
separated radical and ion species following a single electron
oxidation or reduction event.8 In the context of designing
sustainable NRFBs, we envision the fragmentation process to
liberate the damaged redox-active cores allowing the deposited
redoxmer to return to solution and restore the electrode
surface (Scheme 1). In the literature, many classes of molecular
scaﬀolds such as alkoxyamines,9,10 aromatic disulﬁdes,11 enol
carbonates,12 and haloacetonitriles13 have been reported to

undergo mesolytic cleavage. Among these, homobenzylic
ethers (HBEs) are of practical interest as their mesolytic
cleavage properties have been previously utilized for the
development and applications of electron-transfer-initiated
reactions.14 Therefore, HBE was chosen as the molecular
scaﬀold for mesolytic cleavage motif in this work.
For a molecule to undergo mesolytic cleavage, it must ﬁrst
be oxidized or reduced. Hence, identifying candidate tether
motifs with suitable cleavage potentials is the ﬁrst important
step toward the imagined restoration function. As shown in
Figure 1a, an HBE scaﬀold with simple functional group
variations generates a set of 1400 molecular candidates
through systematic enumeration. The experimental investigation of such a vast structural space is impractical, being both
time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, accurate quantum
mechanical calculations, e.g., density functional theory (DFT),
provide an alternative to accelerate the screening process.15−17
Indeed, it has been shown that DFT-computed redox
potentials of organic molecules are in good agreement with
experimental measurements.18−20 For example, Davis and Fry
performed DFT simulations to compute reduction and
oxidation potentials for 51 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

and showed a mean absolute deviation of 0.056 V compared to
the experimental measurememnts.18
As the number of functional groups increases, the number of
possible HBEs also grows in a combinatorial fashion.
Therefore, even high-throughput computational screening
approaches will eventually become intractable. Recently,
machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to
predict various materials properties including crystal stability,21,22 diﬀusion barrier,23 band gap,24,25 melting point,26
superconducting transition temperature,27 catalytic activity,28,29 and others.30,31 Consequently, ML oﬀers an accelerated approach to materials screening and discovery from
extensive molecular libraries.32−38 Compared to physics-based
calculations (e.g., DFT), ML models oﬀer a more eﬃcient
method for materials exploration of very large search space.39
However, a reliable supervised ML model such as regression
often requires a substantial amount of training data, which
typically come from expensive simulations or a large number of
experiments. Active learning, on the other hand, constructs a
self-improving cycle that dynamically queries new data for
evaluation to maximize its predictive power. Thus, active
learning is most useful when data are scarce or diﬃcult to
produce, which is often the case in materials research. Indeed,
successful demonstrations of active learning applied to

materials discovery have been highlighted across multiple
disciplines in the recent literature.40−46
Here, we employed high-throughput DFT calculations and
an active learning model based on Bayesian optimization (BO)
to screen HBEs for the ideal design of redoxmers capable of
programmed destruction. As the ﬁrst step toward this goal, we
aim to develop a computational method to identify HBE
tethers that have redox potentials suitable for a particular
electrochemical cell that operates using a given pair of half
reactions. Speciﬁcally, for potential compatibility with catholytes in NRFBs, it is desirable to select HBEs with an
oxidation potential (here noted as Eox implying that mesolytic
cleavage is initiated by the oxidation of the molecule) between
1.40 and 1.70 V (vs NHE) for two primary reasons. First,
many catholytes including dialkoxybenzenes (DMB),47 anthraquinone, 48 and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl
(TEMPO)49 have oxidation potentials below 1.40 V vs
NHE, so they could be cycled without triggering HBE cleavage
until the latter is wanted. Second, applying high oxidative
potentials past 1.70 V is known to cause a breakdown in typical
NRFB electrolytes and solvents, such as acetonitrile, which is
used here for the calculation of Eox. With such criteria, we built
a library of HBEs and computed their corresponding oxidation
potentials. Subsequently, we assessed a Gaussian process
regression model for Eox prediction of HBEs as a potential

identiﬁed a total of 133 molecules with the desired Eox between
1.40 and 1.70 V (Table S1), which constitutes ca. 9% of the
entire HBE candidate library. From Table S1, we noted the
majority of the identiﬁed HBEs possess either a methoxy
(64%) or a phenyl functional group (35%) at the para position
of the benzene ring in the scaﬀold (i.e., R3 = −OMe or −Ph in
Figure 1a). Furthermore, for a randomly selected subset of 10
HBEs, Table S2 shows the exergonic nature of bond
fragmentations upon one-electron oxidation and indicates the
presence of mesolytic cleavages among the identiﬁed
molecules. A more rigorous redox-triggered mesolytic cleavage
study employing both computations and experiments will be
carried out in the future.
Feature Generation and Dimensionality Reduction.
In order to create an accurate model to predict Eox for HBEs,
we utilized an extensive set of physical and chemical
descriptors such as molecular weight, topological surface
area, number of valence electrons, and number of aromatic
rings. A total of 49 such features were generated automatically
from SMILES inputs using RDKit and tabulated in Table S3.
Pearson correlation analysis indicates no single feature among
those 49 can reliably capture the trend of computed Eox
(Figure S2 and Table S3). Therefore, to extract the key
components as well as reduce the dimensionality of our feature
vector, we performed principle component analysis (PCA). In
PCA, original feature components are combined linearly to
create new features called principle components (PCs). These
PCs are not only linearly independent but also created in a
hierarchical order of their contributions such that the ﬁrst PC
captures the most variability in the data, followed by the
second PC and so on. When PCA was performed on our data
set, we found that 30 PCs are enough to account for 100% of
the variance among all 1400 HBEs (Figure S3). Furthermore,
since the ﬁrst 15 PCs already explains 99.7% of the variance,
they were chosen as the ﬁnal feature set that yields a
reasonable compromise between accuracy and eﬃciency. In
Figure 2 the distribution of Eox is also plotted against two
leading PCs (i.e., PCs that account for the most variance),
namely, PC-1 and PC-2. From small HBEs such as (2methoxyethyl) benzene on the far left (1) to large molecules

developed and evaluated the performance of Bayesian
optimization on the DFT-computed data set as well as a
previously unseen data set to search for optimal HBE
candidates.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Library Generation and High-Throughput DFT Simulation. The systematic enumeration of HBEs with various
functional groups (Rs) begins with a scaﬀold in the form of a
Simpliﬁed Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES)
string, namely, [R3]C1 = CC = C(C([R4])([R5])C([R2])[O][R1]) C = C1. Then, by substituting the R-designated
residues within the scaﬀold with the appropriate functional
groups (also in SMILES format), a total of ca. 1400 unique
HBEs were generated (Figure 1a). Note that this is not an
exhaustive collection of such functional groups. This initial set
was chosen primarily for their electron-donating and -withdrawing properties, as well as ease of synthesis. Overall, this
HBE data set is diverse as the constituent molecules are
composed of 10−39 heavy (i.e., non-hydrogen) atoms and ﬁve
elements: C, H, O, N, and Br. To validate our computational
approach, we compared DFT-derived oxidation potentials with
cyclic voltammetry measurements for 11 HBE molecules from
the data set. The benchmarking results show a mean absolute
error of 0.11 V (Figure S1), indicating suﬃcient accuracy of
our DFT method in computing oxidation potentials. In order
to perform DFT calculations on all generated species, we
employed a high-throughput workﬂow that primarily consists
of two steps (Figure 1b): (1) Conversion of SMILES inputs to
three-dimensional structures, of which initial conformations
were created at the force-ﬁeld level (MMFF94) as
implemented in the cheminformatics software RDKit.50 (2)
Generation and mass submission of simulation input scripts to

for 1400 HBEs is shown in Figure 1c, with the mean (μ) and
standard deviation (σ) of 1.98 and 0.55 V, respectively.
According to Figure 1c, the evaluated HBEs possess a wide Eox
window, ranging from 0.50 to 3.50 V. Most importantly, we

using diﬀerent feature sets are plotted in Figure S4, which
shows similar accuracy (RMSE < 0.15 V) for models utilizing
either 15 PCs, 30 PCs, or 49 original features. Again, this
observation conﬁrms the adequacy of our choice of the 15 PCs
as descriptors for Eox prediction.
According to Figure 3a, we found that increasing the train/
test ratio beyond 60% did not lead to any notable
improvement in accuracy. The ﬁnal regression model, utilizing
a train/test ratio of 60%, yields accurate Eox predictions with R2
= 0.97 and RMSE = 97 mV with respect to DFT-computed
values (Figure 3b). Such excellent predictive power of our
GPR model provides us conﬁdence in constructing a Bayesian
optimization model to identify HBE candidates with desirable
Eox, wherein GPR serves as the surrogate model.
Bayesian Optimization (BO) for Prediction of Materials with Desirable Oxidation Potentials. The goal of a BO
process applied to computational materials screening is to
eﬃciently identify candidates with desired property while
requiring only a minimal number of expensive evaluations such
as DFT calculations. At the beginning of a typical BO process,
a small, randomly selected number of the data points are used
to train a surrogate model. Then, based on the predicted mean
values and uncertainties obtained from the surrogate model,
the acquisition function optimizes the objective function by
suggesting the next data point(s) for evaluation. New labeled
data are used to improve the surrogate model and complete
one BO iteration.

illustrates the structural and electrochemical diversity of our
library of 1400 HBEs.
Prediction of Oxidation Potentials of Materials Using
Gaussian Process Regression. With the 15-PC feature
vectors, we built a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model
to predict the oxidation potentials51 of HBEs. GPR is a
nonparametric (i.e., not limited to a functional form) approach
to regression with the ability to provide uncertainty on the
predictions. The statistically meaningful predictions are based
on a Bayesian framework, wherein a prior Gaussian process is
formulated from training data and a covariance (or kernel)
function. In this work, we used the Matérn kernel, a
generalization of the radial basis function, to construct the
covariance matrices (see Methods). Two metrics were used to
evaluate the performance of the GPR models, namely, root
mean squared error (RMSE) and coeﬃcient of determination
(R2). Nine models were tested to determine the optimal train/
test ratio, and the resulting learning curve is shown in Figure
3a. The construction of each model ﬁrst involves selecting a
percentage (between 10% and 90% in our case) of the entire
library of HBEs to serve as the training set. Then, the
remaining molecules, which have not been seen by the model,
are used as the test data set. In addition, a total of 100 runs
(each run starting with a random training/test split) were
repeated for each model to build a reasonable statistic of the
model performance.52 For comparison, similar learning curves

The speciﬁc BO process used in the evaluation of 1400
HBEs is shown in Figure 4a. Initially, we employed 10
randomly chosen HBEs and their corresponding DFTcomputed Eox to train a GPR surrogate model in a similar
fashion as the one detailed in the previous section. This GPR
model was used to make predictions of Eox for the remaining
HBE molecules in the library. Then, the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function utilized both the prediction and
the uncertainty to suggest the next best HBE candidate for
DFT evaluation. The EI is a widely used state-of-the-art
acquisition function that balances between exploitation
(following the trend of the current best estimates) and
exploration (diversifying the search to avoid local optima).
Once the Eox value of the new HBE was computed, it was
added to the current training data set to retrain the GPR model
in the next iteration of the BO loop (Figure 4a, red). In order
to evaluate the performance of BO on our HBE database, we
programmed the BO cycle to repeat until a total of 30
molecules with Eox ∈ [1.40 V, 1.70 V] are found. Based on the
statistics observed earlier, there is a 9% chance of ﬁnding such
an HBE molecule. This low probability is reﬂected by the slope
of the blue curve in Figure 4b, which was constructed by
randomly selecting HBEs in the database and recording the
number of those with the desired Eox. Indeed, we found that it
would take approximately 330 random selections to ﬁnd 30
desirable HBEs. In comparison, the same number of HBEs
were correctly selected within 60 BO evaluations. Since every
random selection or BO evaluation requires a DFT calculation,
Figure 4b indicates at least 5-fold improvement in eﬃciency in
identifying appropriate candidates obtained from using BO
over the random selection. Similar observation can be seen for
the comparison between BO and Latin hypercube sampling
(Figure S6).
We further examined the generalizability of the BO process
by applying it to a signiﬁcantly larger, previously unseen data
set of approximately 112 000 HBEs. This new data set was
created by incorporating a wider range of R-designated
residues to the HBE scaﬀold (Table S4). We conducted two
independent BO runs, BO1 and BO2, each with an initial
training set of 10 randomly chosen HBEs and set the
maximum number of HBEs to evaluate to 40. With this
setup, both BO runs successfully discovered a number of HBE
molecules with the desired Eox (26 in BO1 and 16 in BO2),
and the evaluation progress of BO1 is shown in Figure 5. It can
be seen that, after an initial exploration within the ﬁrst 15
steps, BO1’s predictive capability starts improving signiﬁcantly
as the gap between the predicted and DFT-computed values
decreases rapidly. Table 1 shows several HBE candidates
discovered by BO1 and their corresponding R-designated
residue identities. Interestingly, we notice that BO1 consistently identiﬁes desired HBEs with either a propoxy or isopropoxy functional group at the R3 position with respect to the
scaﬀold (i.e., R3= −OPr or −OiPr) within 40 BO evaluations.
Similarly, we identiﬁed 16 HBE molecules from BO2. These
structural patterns, together with those found previously in the
133 molecules identiﬁed from the 1400 data set, suggests the
presence of electron donating groups such as alkoxy and
phenyl at the para position for designing HBEs with oxidation
potential window of [1.40 V, 1.70 V vs NHE]. We note that a
complete list of HBE candidates predicted by BO1 and BO2 is
provided in Tables S5 and S6, respectively. In summary, we
demonstrated that BO coupled with DFT is a robust and

CONCLUSIONS
We conducted high-throughput density functional theory
(DFT) simulations to compute oxidation potentials (Eox)
values for 1400 homobenzylic ether (HBE) molecules, to
program redoxmer destruction via a mesolytic cleavage
reaction. We identiﬁed a small percentage, ca. 9%, of these
HBEs to possess Eox in the ideal window of [1.40 V, 1.70 V, vs
NHE]. Based on the performance of an initial Gaussian
process regression (GPR) model for Eox prediction, we
implemented an active learning framework based on Bayesian
optimization (BO) for eﬃcient identiﬁcation of desired HBEs.
The BO not only determined the ideal HBEs correctly but also
demonstrated more than 5-fold improvement in computational
eﬃciency compared to the random selection. When BO was
further applied to a previously unseen data set of 112 000
HBEs, it successfully identiﬁed 42 optimal HBE candidates
after evaluating only 100 molecules. Moreover, BO’s ability to
uncover potential structural patterns that lead to desired
properties may help us recognize important underlying
structure−property relations. The use of active learning to
eﬃciently guide high-throughput quantum mechanical simulations provides an accelerated practice to identify candidate
components suitable for testing design concepts in the
discovery of new materials.

acetonitrile solvent (ϵ = 37.5), self-consistent reaction-ﬁeld (SCRF)
calculations using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model

using an ultraﬁne grid. The oxidation potentials, Eox, were computed
from the Gibbs free energy change at 298 K (ΔGox) for the
elimination of an electron from the species of interest (ΔGox = Goxidized
− Gneutral), using the equation:57
