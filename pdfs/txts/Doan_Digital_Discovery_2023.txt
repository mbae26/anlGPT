A priori catalyst design guidelines from ﬁrst principles simulations and reliable data-driven models are
essential for cost eﬃcient catalyst discovery. Nonetheless, acquiring all properties that control catalytic
activity and stability is computationally challenging due to the complex interactions among reactants,
intermediates, and products at the active sites. Therefore, predictions of only the most relevant catalytic
properties, or catalyst descriptors, are often used to guide new catalyst design. In the context of
upgrading biomass materials via deoxygenation reaction to value-added chemicals, the molybdenum
carbides (Mo2C) have been considered among the most active and economically viable catalysts.
Unfortunately, one of the bottlenecks related to longer term stability of Mo2C catalysts is the
susceptibility to surface oxidation, a common problem in heterogeneous catalysis, which requires the
use of excess hydrogen for active site regeneration. By using surface dopants to tune the oxygen aﬃnity
(catalyst descriptor) of Mo2C surfaces, it is possible to design new doped Mo2C catalysts with desired
reactivity and stability. Here, we ﬁrst employed periodic density functional theory to perform 20 000
high-throughput VASP simulations of oxygen binding energies (BEO) on various pristine and doped Mo2C
surfaces. We computed and developed a binding energy database of 20 000 oxygen adsorption
structures consisting of 7 low Miller-index surfaces, 23 d-block elements as single-atom dopants, all
possible surface terminations, dopant locations, and adsorption sites. Utilizing this dataset, we developed

been considered the promising catalyst candidates for HDO
reactions3–9 as they are of low cost and, in the case of Mo2C, can
achieve Pt-like catalytic activity.7 Furthermore, strategies to
modify Mo2C catalysts with transition metals to enhance HDO
activity has been employed in both experimental and computational studies.10–15 A key challenge remaining with Mo2C as an
HDO catalyst is the surface susceptibility to oxygen poisoning,
which requires excess H2 for the regeneration of the catalyst.16
Therefore, attenuating oxygen aﬃnity toward Mo2C surface is
necessary to improve the overall catalytic stability and performance. To this end, our previous computational study
demonstrated that, by doping Mo2C surfaces with Ni atoms at
low concentration, it is possible to weaken oxygen atom binding
energy (BEO) strength and subsequently enable the ease of
oxygen removal via water formation and desorption.11 Such
evidence also indicates that the computed BEO values on Mo2Cbased catalyst surfaces may be used as descriptors to gauge the
stability against oxidation.

Introduction
Biomass conversion technology has the potential to alleviate
our dependence on fossil fuels and promote a sustainable
energy future.1 To produce fuels and chemicals, raw biomass
materials must be rst transformed into bio-oils via fast pyrolysis. The high oxygen content in bio-oils is undesirable and

Paper

In recent years, computational screenings of descriptors
have been carried out for various catalytic systems including
bimetallic alloys,17–19 single-atom catalysts,20 and transition
metal carbides and nitrides6 via density functional theory (DFT)
simulations. Nevertheless, the high cost of DFT calculations
remains the bottleneck of high-throughput descriptor generation. To circumvent such problem, machine learning (ML)
models utilizing existing DFT-computed datasets have been
developed to accelerate the prediction of catalytic descriptors
such as binding energies,21–32 adsorption dynamics,33 d-band
centers,34 and activation energy barriers.35,36 Notably, graph
neural networks (GNNs) previously employed for property
prediction of molecules37–40 have been quickly adopted for
crystalline materials.41–44 Perhaps, an attractive feature of GNN
over typical ML approaches is the use of neural graph ngerprint37 that enables the prediction and interpretation of global
properties based on local atomic contributions. To date, GNN
frameworks such as message passing neural network (MPNN),45
crystal graph convolutional neural network (CGCNN),41 materials graph network (MEGNet),46 and SchNet47 provide exible
methods for training ML models to predict properties of various
materials from isolated molecules to bulk crystals to catalytic
surfaces. For an in-depth review of these GNN models and their
performance benchmark, we refer the readers to a recent
publication by Fung et al.48
Applications of GNNs in computational heterogenous catalysis have been demonstrated recently via the prediction of
binding energies of various catalytic surface intermediates.43,49,50 For clarity and practicality, the following reported
mean absolute errors (MAEs), an accuracy metric of MLpredicted values relative to DFT values, are for the predictions
on geometries prior to DFT optimization only (i.e., unrelaxed
geometries). With a dataset of ca. 40 000 datapoints,18 Back and
colleagues developed and trained a CGCNN to predict adsorption energies of CO and H on bimetallic alloys and obtained an
MAE of 0.19 eV for both species.49 Gu et al.50 further improved
the accuracy of CGCNN-predicted binding energies of CO and H
(MAECO = 0.128 eV and MAEH = 0.096 eV) using the same
dataset but a diﬀerent representation for the adsorption sites. In
lieu of atom-based features, Fung and co-workers used the
density of states of the surface atoms to develop a convolutional
neural network for binding energy prediction.43 A diverse set of
monoatomic (H, C, N, O, and S) and hydrogenated species (CH,
CH2, CH3, NH, OH, and SH) on bimetallic alloy surfaces was
employed (∼37 000 adsorption geometries). On average, an
MAE value on the order of 0.1 eV was achieved. While these
seminal examples highlight GNNs are useful to predict
adsorption energies of various reaction intermediates quickly
and accurately, the compositional nature of the datasets limits
their applicability to only bimetallic transition metal alloys
during computational catalyst screening.
Similar to bimetallic systems, computational screening of
adsorption energies such as BEO for Mo2C-based catalysts is an
important but challenging task. However, unlike binary alloys,
doped Mo2C structures typically consist of up to three elements
(metal dopant, Mo, and C) and are therefore more complex in
composition. Furthermore, metal carbide surfaces are

Å. The bulk unit cell was sliced to create 7 low Miller-index
surfaces including (100), (010), (001), (110), (101), (011), and
(111) (see Fig. S1†). For each surface index, all possible terminations were considered, and a total of 54 unique surface
terminations were generated for pristine Mo2C. The pristine

structurally diverse, yielding multiple terminations per surface
index.51 The diﬃculty in developing accurate GNN models for
catalyst property prediction in similar ternary systems such as
ternary alloys52 and binary oxides53 have been addressed
recently. Given a similar size of training data (∼104), the MAE of
GNN-predicted adsorption energies on bimetallic alloys can
reach a value of 0.1 eV, whereas the MAE obtained for a dataset
containing ternary alloys is approximately one order of magnitude less accurate at MAE = 1.0 eV.52 Therefore, it is necessary to
further improve the performance of ML models on ternary
catalyst systems by creating more diverse datasets and
improving feature representation. In this work, we aimed to
generate high-delity DFT data for ∼20 000 catalyst models
(doped Mo2C catalysts) and develop GNN models with suitable
graph representation for accurate oxygen binding energy
predictions. To do so, as shown in Scheme 1, we rst enumerated approximately 20 000 adsorption geometries for oxygen on
pristine and doped Mo2C catalyst surfaces and carried out DFT
calculations to evaluate their corresponding BEO values. Then,
we utilized this dataset to develop a message passing neural
network using local coordination graph representation (LCGMPNN) for BEO prediction. Finally, in addition to the development of the data-driven deep learning model, we analyzed the
representations learned by our model to better understand the
eﬀect of surface structure and composition on BEO.

terminations were then doped with 23 diﬀerent transition metal
elements (see Fig. S2†), one at a time, by replacing a surface Mo
atom with a dopant atom. Finally, all possible oxygen adsorption sites were enumerated on both pristine and doped Mo2C
surfaces via Delaunay triangulation as implemented in the
Catalysis Kit (CatKit) package.54 Note that the placement of the
oxygen atom is not required to be in the immediate vicinity of
a dopant atom. A total of 20 177 oxygen adsorption structures

described by the generalized gradient approximation Perdew–
Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE)61 functional. While electron
correlation in some transition metal carbides may be resolved
using PBE + U functional, it can become computationally
prohibitive for large-scale screening. Hence, we chose to neglect
both Hubbard U correction and spin polarization in the

evaluation of BEO to preserve a good trade-oﬀ between accuracy
and computational cost. A Gaussian smearing with Fermi
temperature of 0.1 eV was employed and the total energies (E)
were subsequently extrapolated to kBT = 0.0 eV.62 The energy
convergence criterion for the electronic self-consistent iterations was set to 10−4 eV. For geometry optimization, the forces
were converged below 0.05 eV Å−1.
All pure and doped Mo2C catalyst surfaces were modelled as
(1 × 1) unit cell slabs. Each slab is at least 5 Å in width and
length and consists of an equivalent of four layers (see Fig. S3†).
All slabs were separated with a vacuum of 20 Å along the normal
direction to the surface. The Brillouin zone for these systems
was sampled using a 6 × 6 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid.63

dataset as this is approximately equal to the distance between
two coordinated Mo atoms in the top layer.

Message passing neural network using local coordination
graph representation (LCG-MPNN)
To represent an input adsorption geometry of the catalyst in the
deep learning models, we constructed a local coordination
graph (LCG) consisting of the adsorbate and its neighbouring
atoms as nodes and their connections to one another as edges,
which is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1a, up to two nearest-neighbour
coordination shells surrounding the adsorbed O atom are
accounted for in our implementation as they have been previously shown to contribute signicantly to the binding energy of
small adsorbates.49 To determine whether there is a bond/edge
to be included between two atoms/nodes in an LCG representation, we employ the following distance criterion:
dij − (Ri + Rj) < D

(2)

where dij is the distance between the centres of atom i and atom
j, Ri and Rj are the covalent radii of atom i and atom j, respectively. Thus, a bonded interaction between two atoms is
considered if their skin-to-skin distance is smaller than D. For
the O/Mo2C catalyst models, D is chosen to be 0.25 Å, as this
value provides a stable count for the number of nearest neighbours to the adsorbed oxygen atom on optimized catalyst
surfaces (see Fig. S4†).
In each LCG, nodes and edges are initially encoded with atom
and bond features. Specically, element type, coordination
number, atom type (adsorbate, 1st, or 2nd nearest neighbour),
and list of neighbour atoms are used as atom features. For
bonds, each is distinguished by type, distance, and the atom pair
that it connects. Two types of bonds are considered: adsorption
bonds between O and a catalyst surface atom or lattice bonds
between diﬀerent catalyst surface atoms. The connectivity
matrix, atom, and bond features form the inputs for the machine
learning model. The inputs are stored as undirected graphs in
“.graphml” le format and can be fed directly to the ML model
for a faster pre-processing step (see GitHub page).
The general architecture of our ML model is based on the
MPNN framework rst introduced by Gilmer et al.45 and later
applied by St John and co-workers for polymer screening.38 We
chose MPNN model as it has been shown to provide the best
accuracy for adsorption energy predictions for alloy catalysts
compared to other graph neural networks including CGCNN,
SchNet, MEGNet, and GCN in a recent benchmarking study.48
Here, we modied the Python code developed by St John to
operate on the LCG representation for catalyst slabs. A schematic of the neural network is shown in Fig. 1b. In the input
graph layer, atom and bond classes are embedded into trainable
feature vectors of 32 dimensions. The message passing layer
passes information (m) among neighbouring atoms using
matrix multiplication as follows:
X
mtþ1
¼
Aevw htw ;
(3)
v
w˛NðvÞ

Digital Discovery

where v is the atom index, N(v) is the neighbouring atom indices
of atom v, Aevw is the feature matrix consisting of edge/bond
feature vectors between neighbouring atoms (evw), and htw is
the feature vector of atom w at time step t. A gated recurrent unit
(GRU) block64 is then used to update atom feature vector from
step t to t + 1:
= GRU(htv, mt+1
ht+1
v
v ).

(4)

As shown in Fig. 1b, the embedded feature matrix (h0v ) is
passed through n message passing and GRU blocks before the
output graph layer. The output graph layer was implemented as
a read-out function that takes the nal GRU outputs to produce
the whole graph/graph-level features (y). Four read-out functions were tested including the ‘sum’, ‘max’, and ‘min’ of the
nth node state, and the set2set model from Vinyals et al.65
Finally, three fully connected neural network layers with ReLU
activation functions were used to produce the nal output,
which is the predicted BEO.

Results and discussions
Analysis of BEO on Mo2C surfaces
The distribution of 20 000 DFT-computed BEO on pristine and
doped Mo2C surfaces is shown in Fig. 2. The mean and standard
deviation of BEO are −3.64 eV and 0.95 eV, respectively. From
Fig. 2, overall, doped Mo2C surfaces (blue histograms) possess
a noticeably wider range of BEO ([−6.18 eV, −0.04 eV]) compared
to their pristine (red histograms) Mo2C counterparts ([−5.15 eV,
−0.35 eV]). Additionally, the distribution tails in Fig. 2 suggest
that, with respect to pristine Mo2C surfaces, there are more
doped surfaces with stronger (more negative) BEO than those
with weaker (less negative) BEO.
The BEO of all doped surfaces based on dopant category are
shown in Fig. 3. As a reference, the oxygen binding energy data
for pristine Mo2C is shown on top and labelled as “Mo”. The

hence most widely studied surface for modelling orthorhombic
Mo2C catalysts.66,67 The BEO on doped Mo2C(100) is shown as
the red circles in Fig. 3. Based on the computed BEO, several
observations can be made for BEO on doped Mo2C(100)
compared to all doped surfaces. First, the eﬀect of the 1st NN
dopants on BEO (Fig. 3a) is much stronger than that of the 2nd
NN counterparts (Fig. 3b). Second, the trend in BEO with respect
to dopant element position in the periodic table is identical
between Mo2C(100) and all facets. These results indicate that
the Mo2C(100) is a reasonable model facet for a qualitative
assessment of dopant eﬀects on oxygen adsorption in Mo2C
catalysts.

Machine learning prediction of BEO on Mo2C surfaces
Fig. 3 Distribution of 20k computed O binding energies (BEO) on all
considered Mo2C surfaces with respect to dopant element and its
vicinity to O. Diﬀerent bar colours correspond to diﬀerent dopant
elements. The dopant may be present in the 1st (a) or 2nd (b) nearest
neighbour (NN) of adsorbed O. Mo dopant indicates the pristine Mo2C
surfaces. Red circles represent BEO on doped Mo2C(100) facets only.
Note: binding energy of O on Mo2C(100) doped with Au atom in 1st
nearest neighbour (NN) could not be obtained due to surface reconstruction upon O adsorption and geometry relaxation. In these box
plots, the box length indicates the interquartile range (middle 50% of
BEO) wherein the inner vertical black line shows the median value. The
outliers are shown as black diamonds.

presence of outliers is largely due to the rearrangement of
catalyst surface atoms upon oxygen adsorption or the formation
of surface carbon monoxide. The eﬀects of dopants on BEO can
be diﬀerentiated by their vicinity to the adsorbed oxygen atom,
e.g., whether the dopant atom is in the rst (Fig. 3a) or second
(Fig. 3b) coordination shell. For the latter, as the dopant atom is
further away from the adsorbed oxygen, negligible diﬀerences
compared to pristine Mo2C are observed (Fig. 3b). In contrast,
the presence of a dopant atom in the rst coordination shell can
strongly inuence the magnitude of BEO (Fig. 3a). Furthermore,
we observed that the presence of Zn, Cu, or Ni dopants weakens
the binding strength of oxygen atom on the catalytic facets,
whereas Cr, V, and Ti dopants strengthen the binding strength
of oxygen atoms. In addition, a trend in BEO with respect to the
position of dopant element in the periodic table is observed. In
general, from le to right, i.e., group IV to XII, and top to
bottom, i.e., period 4 to 6, across the transition metals, the
magnitude of BEO decreases gradually. For example, the median
jBEOj of Ti-doped, Fe-doped, and Zn-doped Mo2C surfaces are
4.91, 3.94, and 3.80 eV, respectively. Similarly, the median jBEOj
decreases from 3.73 to 3.22 eV for Mo2C surfaces doped with Cu
and Au. Since dopant electronegativity also increases in the
same directions, it may have an inversely proportional eﬀect on
BEO. We have also identied that the computed diﬀerence in
BEO distribution is negligible among the 7 considered low
Miller-index surfaces (Fig. S5†).
To gauge the BEO trend on a specic catalyst surface, we
chose Mo2C(100) as an example, as it is the closest-packed and

A useful ML model for predicting BEO on Mo2C catalyst surfaces
should only require unoptimized adsorption geometries inputs
since geometry optimization of a catalyst facet with adsorbate is
computationally demanding. Therefore, we developed our LCGMPNN model using unoptimized adsorption geometries as the
inputs and the computed BEO of optimized geometries as the
prediction outputs. To validate our model, we reserved 20% of
the data (∼4000 randomly selected datapoints) for testing and
used the remaining data for hyperparameter optimization and
cross-validation. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using
Bayesian optimization (BO) via the Tree Parzen Estimator
method.68 A total of 100 BO cycles were carried out, and the
results are presented in Table S1.† We identied the best model
architecture with nine message passing layers, a set2set readout function, and three fully connected layers of 256, 32, and
256 dimensions (Table S1†). With this architecture, we performed 4-fold cross-validation and obtained an average MAE of
0.175 eV. Finally, we applied the most accurate model to the
holdout test set and achieved an MAE of 0.176 eV (Fig. 4a). Close
inspection on the model performance with respect to various
ranges of the computed BEO indicates a strong dependence on
the availability of the training data as shown in the inset of
Fig. 4a. Specically, at the upper/right tail of the computed BEO
distribution where BEO > −1.0 eV, the scarcity of training data/
optimized surface geometries (Fig. 2) lead to a high local MAE of
0.680 eV. In Fig. 4b, we show that the size of the dataset strongly
inuences the performance (MAE) of the ML model. As the MAE
decreases with increasing data size, it reaches a reasonable
accuracy of ca. 0.20 eV when 15k catalyst surfaces of pristine and
doped Mo2C are utilized by the model. Besides data availability,
the model performance on the test set is also found to vary with
respect to the 7 considered surface indices, with the MAE
ranging from 0.086 eV for (001) surfaces to 0.338 eV for (111)
surfaces (see Fig. S6†).
To validate our choice of input representations and features,
we modied several important parameters of the model and reexamined its performance, as shown in Table 1. For example,
expanding the coordination shell to account for 3rd NN atoms
gives a marginal accuracy improvement of 9 meV (entry ii) from
the default model (entry i), but increases the number of training
parameters by 50k. In addition, employing an entirely diﬀerent
atom feature set41 that focuses on elemental properties such as

Table 1 Performance of LCG-MPNN model with the default and
modiﬁed parameters

The ability of the LCG-MPNN to learn structure and composition representations of Mo2C surfaces was investigated by the t-

distributed Stochastic Neighbouring Embedding (t-SNE)
method to map the relationships between the learned graphlevel features (from the read-out layer) and BEO. This analysis
is shown in Fig. 5. Since the graph-level feature of each
adsorption geometry is represented by a 32-dimensional data
point, we used t-SNE to determine a human-interpretable, 2dimensional (2D) version of these representations that still
reects how points are similar in the original 32-dimensional
space, as shown in Fig. 5a. The distinct coloured regions
observed in Fig. 5a indicate the eﬀectiveness of the learned
graph features in capturing various magnitudes of BEO. For
example, going diagonally from the bottom le to the top right
of the t-SNE plot, O binding energies transition from strong
binding (dark blue, BEO < −5.0 eV) to intermediate binding
(white, BEO ∼ −3.0 eV) to weak binding (dark red, BEO > −1.0
eV) areas.
Further analysis of the selected strong (blue rectangle),
intermediate (black rectangle), and weak (red rectangle) O
binding regions of the t-SNE plot is shown in Fig. 5b–d,
respectively. In these gures, the distribution of surface indices
and O coordination numbers is explored to provide some
understanding on the nature of the learned graph representation. For the strong binding region (Fig. 5b), most catalyst
surfaces possess a O coordination number of 2, which corresponds to a ‘bridge’ adsorption site. In contrast, we found that
O adsorption at ‘3-fold’ (O coordination number = 3) and ‘4fold’ (O coordination number = 4) sites to have the largest
fraction in the weak binding region as shown in Fig. 5d. For the
intermediate binding region (Fig. 5c), the dominating fraction
of surfaces is of (101) index with atomic oxygen at 3-fold binding
sites. From these observations, we believe that both the surface
index, which relates to the arrangement of surface atoms, and O
coordination number should play an important role in the
overall learned graph feature representation. Such conclusion
remains true when diﬀerent areas of strong, intermediate, and

atomic volume and covalent radius did not improve the model
(entry iii). Since the LCG-GNN model uses unrelaxed adsorption
structures as inputs, we also tested the model sensitivity on how
these structures are generated. While the relative position of an
adsorbed oxygen atom (Oads) with respect to those of surface
atoms (e.g., top, bridge, or 3-fold) is determined via geometric
methods, their distances are not required to achieve reasonable
prediction accuracy. Indeed, excluding distance values between
Oads and its nearest neighboring surface atoms only (entry iv)
leads to a small decrease in the model performance (DMAE = 12
meV). In contrast, we noted the importance of pairwise
distances among surface atoms of the catalyst, as their absence
as input features (entry v) has a detrimental eﬀect on the model
accuracy (DMAE = 35 meV). These observations indicate that
whereas the input adsorption structures are insensitive to the
exact placement of Oads, it is necessary to employ optimized
lattice constants during structure generation to maximize the
performance of the ML model.

(a) 2D t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) plot of graph-level features from the readout layer. Each point represents an
adsorption geometry from the training set, of which colour was mapped to the computed oxygen binding energy (BEO). The oxygen coordination number distribution of adsorption geometries in the regions enclosed by blue, black, and red rectangles are shown in (b), (c), and (d),
respectively.

weak BEO were selected (see Fig. S7†). Finally, we note that in all
three considered O binding regions in Fig. 5, no single element
yields a signicant contribution to any of the dominating
surface populations (see Fig. S8†).

Elucidating feature importance from neural network
gradients

and its surroundings (i.e., nearby Mo or C atom). As seen in the
le panel of Fig. 6, the Ta atom provides a larger contribution,
compared to the other bridging Mo atom, to the prediction of
strong O adsorption on Ta–Mo2C(100) surface. On pristine
Mo2C(101) surface (Fig. 6, middle panel), three Mo atoms in the
‘3-fold’ conguration are observed to have higher impact on the
predicted output compared to the rest of the surface atoms.

The t-SNE plot in Fig. 5 provides a useful visual correlation
between the learned graph features and the DFT-computed BEO,
however, it does not show the contribution of each input feature
to the nal prediction output, the binding energy of oxygen to
the catalyst site (BEO). Such contribution can be evaluated using
the gradient values obtained from the diﬀerential operation of
ML-predicted BEO outputs with respect to the embedding atom
feature inputs, i.e., saliency maps.49,69 A higher magnitude of the
gradient indicates a larger impact of the atom feature on the
prediction. In Fig. 6, normalized gradient values of surface
atoms are shown for three representative catalyst surfaces,
namely Ta–Mo2C(100), Mo2C(101), and Co–Mo2C(010), of the
strong, intermediate, and weak O binding regions of the t-SNE
map (Fig. 5a), respectively. First, the atoms in closer proximity, i.e., 1st nearest neighbour (1st NN), to the bound oxygen
possess higher gradients or stronger inuences on the predicted output. Second, within the same coordination shell,
atom contributions vary with respect to the element identity

Digital Discovery
However, one Mo atom (immediately below the bound O atom)
exhibits the strongest eﬀect among the three. Such diﬀerence
may be attributed to the atom's diﬀerent coordinating environment compared to the other two (i.e., geometry of the
crystal). As shown in Fig. 6, for the doped Co–Mo2C(010) surface
(right panel), all four 1st NN atoms including three Mo and one
Co are observed to contribute relatively evenly to the prediction
of a weak O binding energy (BEO = −1.41 eV). Overall, our
gradient analysis derived from the LCG-MPNN model provides
a useful and intuitive tool for evaluating the importance of
individual surface atom at the local O adsorption site.

Conclusions
In this contribution, to accelerate the estimation of crucial
descriptors for catalyst properties, we have enumerated ca. 20
000 oxygen adsorption geometries on pristine and transition
metal doped Mo2C catalyst surfaces. Periodic DFT calculations
have been used to build a dataset containing optimized
adsorption structures and their corresponding oxygen binding
energies (BEO). From the computed data, the BEO distribution
indicates a strong dependence on the element of the dopant
atom in the rst nearest neighbour with respect to the adsorbed
oxygen. Furthermore, the results from high-throughput DFT
calculations indicate that Zn, Ni, and Cu dopants decrease the
BEO on Mo2C surfaces and could be used to improve surface
stability against oxidation during HDO reactions. It is noted that
surface oxidation of Mo2C is a dynamic and complex process in
which other factors besides BEO such as atomic rearrangement,
dopant diﬀusion, coverage eﬀects, phase stability, and reducibility are also important and should be investigated with further
computational and experimental studies. The high-delity DFT
dataset was utilized to develop and train a message passing
neural network using local coordination graph (LCG-MPNN) to
predict BEO from a graph representation of the unoptimized
geometry. The deep learning model achieves a mean absolute
error of 0.176 eV for BEO on a test set of unoptimized adsorption
structures. Upon studying the learned graph representation of
oxygen adsorption on Mo2C, we identied that the local
arrangement of surface atoms plays an important role in determining BEO and the data-driven model can be used for a fast and
accurate estimation of binding energies. Furthermore, the
gradient calculation from atom feature inputs allows for recognizing feature importance with atomic precision at the oxygen
binding site. Our results highlight the use of LCG-MPNN as an
accurate and broadly applicable machine learning approach for
adsorption energy prediction for accelerated discovery of catalysts for hydrodeoxygenation and beyond. Future work will focus
on improving feature representation, generating adsorption
energy data for other important surface intermediates (e.g., H,
OH and H2O), and utilizing transfer learning to increase the
prediction accuracy and generalizability of this approach.
