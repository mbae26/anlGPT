Therefore, even high-throughput computational screening approaches will eventually become intractable. Recently, machine learning (ML) has been successfully applied to predict various materials properties including crystal stability,21,22 diﬀusion barrier,23 band gap,24,25 melting point,26 superconducting transition temperature,27 catalytic activity,28,29 and others.30,31 Consequently, ML oﬀers an accelerated approach to materials screening and discovery from extensive molecular libraries.32−38 Compared to physics-based calculations (e.g., DFT), ML models oﬀer a more eﬃcient method for materials exploration of very large search space.39 However, a reliable supervised ML model such as regression often requires a substantial amount of training data, which typically come from expensive simulations or a large number of experiments. Active learning, on the other hand, constructs a self-improving cycle that dynamically queries new data for evaluation to maximize its predictive power. Thus, active learning is most useful when data are scarce or diﬃcult to produce, which is often the case in materials research.

       " Document(page_content='Abstract Machine-learning (ML) approaches have proven to be of great utility in modern materials innovation pipelines. Generally, ML models are trained on predetermined past data and then used to make predictions for new test cases. Active-learning, however, is a paradigm in which ML models can direct the learning process itself through providing dynamic suggestions/queries for the “next-best experiment.” In this work, the authors demonstrate how an active-learning framework can aid in the discovery of polymers possessing high glass transition temperatures (Tg). Starting from an initial small dataset of polymer Tg measurements, the authors use Gaussian process regression in conjunction with an active-learning framework to iteratively add Tg measurements of candidate polymers to the training dataset. The active-learning framework employs one of three decision making strategies (exploitation, exploration, or balanced exploitation/exploration) for selection of the “next-best experiment.” The active-learning workﬂow terminates once 10 polymers possessing a Tg greater than a certain threshold temperature are selected. The authors statistically benchmark the performance of the aforementioned three strategies (against a random selection approach) with respect to the discovery of high-Tg polymers for this particular demonstrative materials design challenge.', metadata={'source': '/Users/minseokbae/ANL/gpt3_finetune/data/txts/activelearning_and_materials_design_the_example_of_high_glass_transition_temperature_polymers.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Introduction In order to design new materials for speciﬁc applications, we often have to search for materials which possess a given set of properties within a required window. For example, design of polymers for energy storage applications requires that such materials possess simultaneously high dielectric constant and bandgap. [1–9] Another example is the design of solid polymer electrolytes for Li-ion batteries. Such materials are required to possess a suitably high Li-ion conductivity[10] in conjunction with an appropriate electrochemical window. [11] In order to guide this search for materials with promising functionalities, scientists and researchers often rely on intuition gained from past experiments to design the next set of experiments. Even so, how does one decide whether to continue searching within a particularly promising class of materials or switch to searching for candidates in a more unexplored region of chemical or structural space? Rather than making such decisions based purely on human intuition, active-learning algorithms that exploit Bayesian optimization (BO) frameworks may be utilized. [12–15] Over the past decade, machine-learning (ML)-based algorithms and techniques have been of tremendous utility in a variety of ﬁelds, including in materials science.
