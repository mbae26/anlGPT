Generally, ML models are\\ntrained on predetermined past data and then used to make predictions for new test cases. Active-learning, however, is a paradigm in\\nwhich ML models can direct the learning process itself through providing dynamic suggestions/queries for the “next-best experiment.” In\\nthis work, the authors demonstrate how an active-learning framework can aid in the discovery of polymers possessing high glass transition\\ntemperatures (Tg). Starting from an initial small dataset of polymer Tg measurements, the authors use Gaussian process regression in conjunction with an active-learning framework to iteratively add Tg measurements of candidate polymers to the training dataset. The active-learning framework employs one of three decision making strategies (exploitation, exploration, or balanced exploitation/exploration) for selection of\\nthe “next-best experiment.” The active-learning workﬂow terminates once 10 polymers possessing a Tg greater than a certain threshold temperature are selected. The authors statistically benchmark the performance of the aforementioned three strategies (against a random selection\\napproach) with respect to the discovery of high-Tg polymers for this particular demonstrative materials design challenge.\\n\\nIntroduction\\nIn order to design new materials for speciﬁc applications, we\\noften have to search for materials which possess a given set\\nof properties within a required window. For example, design\\nof polymers for energy storage applications requires that such\\nmaterials possess simultaneously high dielectric constant and\\nbandgap.[1–9] Another example is the design of solid polymer\\nelectrolytes for Li-ion batteries. Such materials are required\\nto possess a suitably high Li-ion conductivity[10] in conjunction\\nwith an appropriate electrochemical window.[11] In order to\\nguide this search for materials with promising functionalities,\\nscientists and researchers often rely on intuition gained from\\npast experiments to design the next set of experiments. Even\\nso, how does one decide whether to continue searching within\\na particularly promising class of materials or switch to searching\\nfor candidates in a more unexplored region of chemical or structural space? Rather than making such decisions based purely\\non human intuition, active-learning algorithms that exploit\\nBayesian optimization (BO) frameworks may be utilized.[12–15]\\nOver the past decade, machine-learning (ML)-based algorithms and techniques have been of tremendous utility in a variety of ﬁelds, including in materials science.[16–19] Approaches\\nto the ML can roughly be divided into two categories, passive\\nand active, each making characteristic assumptions about the\\n\\n† Chiho Kim and Anand Chandrasekaran equally contributed to this work.\\n\\nlearner and its environment.[20] In passive learning approaches\\nsuch as classiﬁcation, clustering, and regression, the ML algorithm or surrogate model can only make inferences on the environment based on the predetermined training data provided to\\nit. Within the active-learning paradigm, however, the learning\\nalgorithm can make dynamic queries or suggestions to direct\\nthe learning process itself. For instance, when faced with a paucity of training data, the ML algorithm can direct the user to\\nprovide data from unexplored regions (quantiﬁed by the prediction) so as to gain knowledge and improve the overall accuracy\\nof the model. On the other hand, provided with some prior userdeﬁned objective/cost function, the algorithm can also direct\\nthe user to sample points which can maximize/minimize this\\nfunction. The former approach of sampling unexplored regions\\nwith large uncertainty is referred to as “exploration” whereas\\nthe latter approach of acquiring data which maximizes the taskspeciﬁc utility of a particular action/measurement is referred to\\nas “exploitation.” Another common strategy is to balance\\nexploration and exploitation, by taking both knowledge gain\\nand the task-speciﬁc utility of actions into account.\\nIn the current report, we outline an active-learning approach\\nto efﬁciently search the chemical space for polymers which\\npossess a glass transition temperature (Tg) higher than a certain\\nminimum threshold. In other words, given an initial (small)\\ndataset of polymers and their corresponding Tg measurements,\\nour algorithm provides dynamic suggestions on the next set of\\npolymers to synthesize and test so as to achieve our objective of\\n\\n▪1\\n\\nMRSofCOMMUNICATIONS\\n• www.mrs.org/mrc\\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

We demonstrate this approach on\\na dataset of 736 polymer Tg measurements that we have curated\\nfrom various publicly available sources of data.[21–23] Our\\nresults indicate that all three strategies (exploitation, exploration, and balance exploitation/exploration) consistently outperform a random search approach. We observe that the two\\nbest-performing strategies are the balanced exploration/exploration and pure exploitation strategies. We notice that the former is the most robust strategy to employ in ﬁnding the most\\nnumber of high-Tg polymers using the least number of “experiments,” particularly when the size of the initial dataset is small.\\nThe active-learning framework and strategies detailed in this\\nwork can be generalized to many materials classes and can\\nalso be used to optimize more than one materials property\\nsimultaneously.\\n\\nMethod\\nFirst, we randomly select ﬁve polymers from the dataset of 736\\npolymers, and pretend that we know the Tg value only for these\\npolymers. We then train a Gaussian process regression (GPR)\\nmodel on just the ﬁve randomly selected polymers; the experimental Tg measurements for the remaining 731 polymers are\\nkept hidden to the learning algorithm. Although this initial\\nmodel is likely highly inaccurate, it provides us with the ability\\nto make predictions of Tg (along with the associated uncertainties) on the remaining 731 candidate polymers. As shown\\nin Fig. 1, we then use one of the three different strategies\\n(explained in the following sections) to iteratively choose the\\nnext-best polymer to synthesize and test (from the 731 remaining polymers) so as to achieve our goal of designing a certain\\nnumber of high-Tg polymers in the shortest possible time.\\nSince this is a demonstrative problem, we do not actually synthesize and test the polymer but instead the Tg of this sixth\\n\\nrecommended polymer is “revealed” to the learning algorithm\\nand added to the training set. A new ML model is trained on\\nthese six polymers and predictions are made for the remaining\\n730 polymers. This loop is repeated continuously until we have\\n“discovered” 10 polymers possessing Tg greater than 450 K.\\nAlthough we only perform a “virtual” experiment in the current work, such frameworks can be used in synergy with actual\\nexperiments[12] or time-consuming ab initio calculations.[24,25]\\nAs mentioned earlier, we utilize one of the three strategies to\\ndetermine the next-best experiment. The three strategies utilize\\nexploitation (searching close to the area of the current best estimate), exploration (searching in unexplored areas), and balanced\\nexploitation/exploration. As explained in more detail in the\\n“Workﬂow” section, the exploitation strategy uses only predicted\\nTg to provide suggestions for the next-best polymer to synthesize\\nand test. On the other hand, the exploration strategy provides\\nsuggestions based on just the uncertainty of predicted Tg of the\\ncandidate polymers (not the prediction itself). Finally, the\\nbalanced exploration/exploitation strategy provides a recommendation based on the utilization of both the predictions and the\\nassociated uncertainties of the remaining candidate polymers.\\nWe statistically evaluate the aforementioned three strategies\\nwithin the context of ﬁnding 10 polymers possessing Tg higher\\nthat 450 K. We also evaluate how the three different strategies\\nperform when changing the size of the initial dataset and also as\\na function of the relative difﬁculty of the objective to be\\nachieved.\\n\\nDataset\\nData for this work were obtained from publicly-available collections of experimental measurements: Polymer Handbook,[21]\\nPrediction of Polymer Properties,[22] and an online repository\\nof polymer properties.[23] The polymer dataset was highly-\\n\\nFigure 1.

In order to visualize the diversity of 736 chemically unique polymers considered in this study, we performed principal component\\nanalysis (PCA) using 244 components of the hierarchical polymer ﬁngerprint (described in the “Hierarchical polymer ﬁngerprinting” section). Figure 2(a) shows distribution of polymers\\nin a two-dimensional (2D) principal component space. Two\\nleading components, PC1 and PC2 are assigned to x and y\\naxes of the plot, respectively. The Tg of each polymer is used\\nto color code the depicted points. As illustrated, the dataset\\nnot only includes common polymers such as polyethylene\\nand polystyrene but also polymers with a large number of\\nrings or those with very long side-chains. Also the Tg of the\\npolymers in the dataset varied widely, ranging from 76 to\\n613 K with a mean of 326 K. A histogram of the distribution\\nof Tg values in the dataset is shown in Fig. 2(b). The repeat\\nunit of the polymers were represented using the simpliﬁed\\nmolecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).[26]\\n\\nHierarchical polymer ﬁngerprinting\\nIn order to comprehensively capture the key features that may\\ncontrol the Tg, we utilized the hierarchical polymer ﬁngerprinting scheme.[27] The ﬁngerprint building process consists of\\nthree hierarchical levels of descriptors. The ﬁrst one is at the\\natomic scale wherein the occurrence of atomic triples (or a\\nset of three contiguous atoms, e.g., C2–C3–C4, made up of a\\ntwofold coordinated oxygen, a threefold coordinated carbon,\\nand a fourfold coordinated carbon) was calculated.[28,29] For\\nthe polymers considered in this study, there are 123 such components. The next level deals with quantitative structure property relationship descriptors, such as van der Waals surface\\narea,[30] topological surface area,[31,32] and fraction of rotatable\\n\\nbonds,[33] implemented in the RDKit cheminformatics\\nlibrary.[34] Such descriptors, 99 in total, form the next set of\\ncomponents of our overall ﬁngerprint. The third level and largest length scale descriptors captured morphological features\\nsuch as the topological distance between rings, fraction of\\natoms that are part of side chains and length of largest side\\nchain.[27] We include a ﬁxed set of 22 such morphological\\ndescriptors.\\n\\nWorkﬂow\\nAs mentioned earlier, we set an arbitrary goal of ﬁnding 10\\npolymers possessing a Tg greater than 450 K. To achieve this\\nobjective, we would have to perform a series of virtual experiments, on one polymer at a time, to obtain the true experimental\\nvalue of Tg for that polymer. At any given point of time, where\\nthe Tg of N polymers have been measured, how does one decide\\nwhich polymer would be the best candidate for the (N + 1)th\\nmeasurement? Instead of performing an experiment on a randomly selected polymer, it would be optimal if a suggestion\\nwas provided via an effective decision-making framework\\n(leveraging experience gained from past measurements) to\\naccomplish the goal of ﬁnding 10 high Tg polymers in the\\nshortest possible time.\\nFirst, we start the design process by setting up an initial dataset with a random selection of ﬁve polymers from the entire\\ndataset of 736 polymers. These ﬁve points are considered as\\n“measured” polymers and will be used for training the initial\\nsurrogate model. Prior to developing the ML models we “ﬁngerprinted” the polymers using a hierarchical polymer ﬁngerprinting technique explained in the previous section. Among\\nthe ﬁngerprint components, several morphological descriptors,\\nsuch as the shortest topological distance between rings, fraction\\nof atoms that are part of side-chains, and the length of the\\n\\nFigure 2.

A radial basis\\nfunction kernel was utilized and ﬁvefold cross validation was\\nused to determine the hyperparameters of the new model at\\nevery iteration of the active learning workﬂow. Once the ML\\nmodel has been built by training on the initial dataset, Tg values\\nfor the candidate polymers are predicted. We investigated the\\nperformance of three decision-making strategies (or acquisition\\nfunctions); exploitation, exploration, and balanced exploitation/\\nexploration, that employ different approaches (based on different\\ncriteria) to provide suggestions for the next-best experiment.\\n• Strategy 1—Exploitation: In this strategy the next-best polymer is the one that has the highest predicted Tg value. This\\nprediction is obtained from an ML model trained on previous\\nexperiments. The exploitation approach favors polymers that\\nare chemically similar to high-Tg polymers in the training set.\\n• Strategy 2—Exploration: Here, the next-best candidate is the\\none which displays the largest uncertainty (as predicted by the\\nGPR model). Such an approach favors exploration of chemical space in order to acquire more information about the\\nglobal landscape of Tg variation across all the polymers to\\nbe tested. As such, this strategy is not optimal for the targeted\\nsearch of high-Tg polymers but we analyze the performance\\nof this approach nonetheless.\\n• Strategy 3—Balanced exploitation/exploration: We utilize\\nthe maximum expected improvement (EI) acquisition function[13,35] to utilize both the prediction and uncertainty to provide the suggestion for the next-best polymer candidate. For\\nexample, especially in the early stages of the dataset expansion, a particular polymer may not possess the highest predicted Tg but it may possess an unusually large uncertainty.\\nSince the EI criterion takes into account both the prediction\\nand the uncertainty, such a polymer may indeed be the\\nmost likely candidate for the next experiment. Within our\\nGPR-based ML framework, the calculated EI metric is nonparametric and it automatically (and dynamically) provides\\na balance between exploration and exploitation approaches.\\nThe equations for the evaluation of the EI metric are shown\\nin the Appendix.\\n• Strategy 4—Random selection: In this strategy, we randomly\\nselect a new candidate polymer, at every iteration, and add it’s\\nTg value to the list of “known” Tg values. The ﬁrst three strategies are evaluated against this random approach.\\nIn order to show the workﬂow in action, Fig. 3 demonstrates\\nhow the ﬁrst three strategies utilize different metrics to choose\\nthe next-best polymer candidate for measurement at one particular iteration. Once 10 polymers possessing Tg greater than\\n450 K are obtained, the workﬂow is terminated and the number\\nof iterations required to achieve this objective is noted. In\\norder to remove the bias due to the initial (random) choice of\\nﬁve polymers, this entire workﬂow was repeated 50 times,\\n\\n4▪\\n\\nfor each strategy, in order to obtain the average number of iterations required for the completion of the objective for each of\\nthe four strategies.\\nSince the performance of each strategy may vary depending\\non the size of the initial dataset or on the difﬁculty of the objective to be achieved, we also look into the relative performance\\nof the four strategies when subject to the aforementioned variations. More speciﬁcally, we analyze the results when starting\\nwith different initial dataset sizes ranging from 5 to 60 and we\\nalso benchmark performance as a function of the threshold temperature (in the range of 300–450 K).\\n\\nResults and discussion\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the above workﬂow is\\ncarried out to evaluate the performance of the three decisionmaking frameworks, i.e., exploitation, exploration, and\\nbalanced exploration/exploitation. In order to obtain statistically meaningful results, the workﬂow is repeated 50 times,\\neach time starting with a different initial dataset (consisting\\nof ﬁve randomly chosen polymers). Figure 4 demonstrates\\nthe number of experiments required (on average) to discover\\n1–10 polymers with a Tg of above 450 K. The error bars denote\\nthe standard deviation across the 50 different runs. For the purpose of comparison, the rates of success when using a random\\napproach are also depicted in Fig. 4.\\nThe average number of experiments required to discover 10\\nhigh-Tg polymers using the exploitation, exploration, balanced\\nexploitation/exploration, and random approaches are 46, 98,\\n30, and 234, respectively. We now analyze the performance\\nof each of the three different strategies individually.\\n• Strategy 1—Exploitation: The exploitation approach is the\\n2nd best-performing approach overall. From Fig. 4, we see\\nthat even though it has a very similar performance relative\\nto the balanced exploitation/exploration approach, it possesses larger error bars. This implies that the exploitation\\nstrategy tends to get stuck in local minima, depending on\\nthe randomly chosen polymers in the initial dataset. As\\ndepicted in Fig. 5(a), we see that exploitation approach is\\nthe best-performing strategy when the initial dataset size is\\nlarge. This is because larger initial dataset sizes lead to models that can predict Tg accurately over a wider range of chemical space. Also, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the exploitation\\napproach also performs well when the threshold temperature\\nfor satisfying the selection criteria is lower. Lowering the\\nthreshold temperature reduces the difﬁculty of the search\\nand exploitation approach is easily able to ﬁnd high-Tg polymers in certain regions of chemical space.\\n• Strategy 2—Exploration: Of the three quantitative decisionmaking strategies, the exploration strategy is the least efﬁcient\\none, even-though it still out performs the random search\\napproach. From Fig. 4, it is interesting to note that the exploration strategy has a sharper slope in the initial stages of the\\nsearch but the rate of success slows down toward the later\\nstages of the search. The exploration approach performs\\n\\nMRS COMMUNICATIONS • www.mrs.org/mrc\\nDownloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.\\nUniversity of Connecticut, on 13 Jun 2019 at 11:51:56, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.78\\n\\n\\x0c\\n\\nArtiﬁcial Intelligence Research Letter\\n\\nFigure 3.

In this particular case, the EI metric leads to the selection of the most suitable candidate, possessing a Tg which is above our required threshold of\\n450 K.\\n\\nFigure 4.

However,\\ntoward the later stages of the search, it is no longer required\\nto search in unexplored regions since the ML model already\\nhas a good understanding of which regions of chemical\\nspace are likely to show high-Tg.\\n• Strategy 3—Balanced exploitation/exploration: The balanced\\nexploitation/exploration approach is the best-performing and\\nmost robust strategy overall. As seen in Fig. 4, it not only performs better than the exploitation approach but it also shows\\nsmall error bars and therefore it has a lower tendency to get\\nstuck in local minima. It signiﬁcantly outperforms the exploitation strategy when the initial size of the dataset is small. The\\nEI metric dynamically provides the right balance between\\nprediction and uncertainty of the prediction when suggesting\\nthe next-best polymer candidate to test.

The authors demonstrate how the active-learning framework can iteratively add Tg measurements of candidate polymers to the training dataset, using different decision-making strategies to select the \"next-best experiment.\" The goal is to design a certain number of high-Tg polymers in the shortest possible time. The research also compares the performance of different strategies against a random selection approach.</b>"

The dataset consisted of 736 chemically unique polymers composed of nine atomic species: C, H, O, N, S, F, Cl, Br, and I. The polymers in the dataset varied widely in terms of their structure and properties, including the glass transition temperature (Tg), which ranged from 76 to 613 K with a mean of 326 K. The repeat unit of the polymers was represented using the simpliﬁed molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).</b>"
