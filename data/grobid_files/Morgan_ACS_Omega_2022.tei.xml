<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Successful transformation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valueadded products is of great interest, as it contributes in part to the circular carbon economy. Understanding chemical interactions that stabilize crucial reaction intermediates of CO 2 is important, and in this contribution, we employ atom centered density matrix propagation (ADMP) molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions between CO 2 -anion radicals with surrounding solvent molecules and electrolyte cations in both aqueous and nonaqueous environments. We show how different cations and solvents affect the stability of the CO 2 -anion radical by examining its angle and distance to a coordinating cation in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify that the strength of CO 2 -interactions can be tailored through choosing an appropriate cation and solvent combination. We anticipate that this fundamental understanding of cation/solvent interactions can facilitate the optimization of a chemical pathway that results from selective stabilization of a crucial reaction intermediate.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS</head><p>Initial geometry optimizations were performed using Gaussian 16 software 50 at the ωb97xD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> with ultrafine integration grids and multiple conformers considered. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> The frequencies were calculated at the same level of theory. Upon geometry optimization, trajectories were calculated using ADMP molecular dynamics at the ωb97xD/ jun-cc-pVDZ level of theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> for 5000 time points (500 fs). ADMP simulations were performed with and without the presence of implicit solvents <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr">57</ref> (water (H 2 O), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (MeCN), and n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF)). Optimized, maximum, mean, and variation amplitude of the CO 2 -angle (θ) and the CO 2</p><p>-distance (to the cation, d) were extracted from the AIMD trajectory. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, the CO 2 -angle (θ) is measured from one oxygen to the other, with the carbon atom as the angle vertex. The CO 2 --to-cation distance (d) is measured from the carbon of the CO 2 -to the center of the cation (either the cation atom or the nitrogen in the ammonium cations). A typical ADMP trajectory is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, where CO 2 -oscillates around its equilibrium position over the course of the simulation. Additional details of the simulations are provided in the Supporting Information (SI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>The interaction strength of two charged particles is inversely related to the separating distance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58</ref> As shown in yellow bars in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, based on the simulations, we observe that the interaction of dynamic water molecules increases the cation-to-CO 2 -distance (Δd) for all cations compared to the gas-phase geometry, which manifests less negative complexation energies and binding energies compared to those in the gas phase (ΔH gas , Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Note that the equations for the complexation enthalpy calculations are provided in the Supporting Information. In the case of the DME solvent system, the chelation of the DME molecule with the alkali metal cation increases the interaction distance for alkali metal cations with the CO 2 -, while for NX 4 + cations (X = Me, Et, and Bu), the difference is minimal (&lt;0.1 Å). This is largely due to the chemical differences between water and DME molecules. Water molecules are strongly polar and have strong ion-dipole interactions with cations and CO 2 -, as seen from the computed complexation enthalpies (ΔH complex ) summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. DME is weakly polar and has chelating interactions with alkali metal cations, where the unshielded positive charge can interact closely with the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms of DME. On the basis of the computed enthalpies of complexation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), the CO 2 -species itself weakly interacts with DME as compared to water (by 0.50 eV) because DME molecules do not have any strong localized partial positive charges. The NBu 4 + positive charge is highly shielded by the butyl arms and as such does not closely interact with the DME oxygen atoms, which also can be seen from our quantum chemical calculations that the difference between ΔH complex and ΔH gas for the NBu 4 + complex is much smaller than that for alkali metal cations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The optimized structures of NBu 4</p><p>+ complexes are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>. The optimized structures of Li + -CO 2 --solvent with DME and H 2 O also corroborate the above analysis; i.e., the oxygen atoms of CO 2 only bind to Li + in the DME solvent, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, whereas in water one of the CO 2 -oxygen atoms binds to Li + , and the other interacts with water to form an O•••H hydrogen bond as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>. Overall, this suggests that the identity of the supporting electrolyte cation, as well as the polarity of solvents, both dictate the strength of interactions of the CO 2 -anion radical, which primarily consist of (electrostatic) ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds. The different types of interactions will be discussed in more detail.</p><p>To further explore how the NX 4 + -CO 2 -interaction responds to the polarity of the solvent, we carried out ADMP simulations with three explicit solvent molecules (in THF, MeCN, DMSO, DMF, and water) and at the same time included the implicit solvent field of corresponding solvent models in Gaussian 16. For these bulky clusters, we repeated each simulation three times with different initial geometries (randomly generated and subsequently optimized) to make sure that the selection of initial structures have no role in dictating the final results. The average and maximum cation-to-CO 2</p><p>-distances are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. We observe that the strength of interaction between NBu 4 + and CO 2 -decreases with increasing solvent polarity, indicated by the increasing cation-to-CO 2 -distance, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Such an observation is consistent with the dominant electrostatic interactions and has experimental implications on salt dissociation or formation of ion pairs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> The positive charge on the NBu 4 + cation is highly shielded by the bulky and electron donating alkyl chains, which means that changing solvents has a relatively minimal effect on the NBu 4 + . However, the strength of the interaction between CO 2 -and NBu 4 + is affected by how strongly CO 2</p><p>-is coordinated to the solvent and cationic species. Thus, increasing the polarity of the solvent increases CO 2</p><p>-coordination with the solvent, weakening the bond between CO 2 -and NBu 4 + . Similar qualitative trends in CO 2 RR were also reported by Berto et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59</ref> and Shi et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60</ref> where voltammetric experiments in the presence of NBu 4 + electrolytes have shown larger current density values for CO 2 RR in highly polar DMF and MeCN, as compared to low polarity THF. Here, DMSO has the largest standard deviation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), which was also found to exhibit the largest deviation from trends due to coordination via the sulfur atom (as opposed to via the oxygen atom in water and THF) in a study of aprotic solvent (THF, DMF, and DMSO) adsorption on metal surfaces by Nørskov and co-workers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref> In aprotic solvents and NBu 4 + salts, tailoring the lifetime of the CO 2</p><p>-will likely depend on solvent, due to the stabilizing influence of more polar solvents.</p><p>The foregoing analysis suggests that both solvents and cations play an important role in the stabilization of the CO 2 radical, <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60</ref> but the precise effects are less clear. On the basis of our simulations, we hypothesize that inner-sphere solvation effects are the result of electrostatic and covalent/noncovalent interactions based around solvent stabilization and cation binding, and to this end, we sought to rationalize these by constructing a simple physics-based model. Compared to gasphase CO 2 -, the introduction of a solvent molecule or a cation reduces the angle of CO 2 -. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>, the largest reductions are observed with cations without solvent molecules, following the trend of Li + &gt; Na + &gt; K + &gt; NX 4</p><p>+ in the gas phase (gray bars), where X = methyl or longer alkyl groups. There is an overall trend of a larger change in the bond angle (Δθ) being  associated with more negative complexation enthalpies, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>, which also indicates that increased complex stability is associated with a decreased CO 2 -angle. This decreased angle is due to anion radical stabilization through ion-ion interactions, ion-dipole interactions, and/or hydrogen bonds. Given the computed trends of solvent polarity and complexation enthalpy simultaneously (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>) and together with known experiment data, we would be able to provide guidance on the electrolyte environments, e.g., with larger stabilizing effects on CO 2 -63 toward the desired binding.</p><p>To decompose the quantum chemistry-calculated complexation enthalpies into stabilization effects by electrostatic ionion interactions and/or ion-dipole interactions explicitly, we have constructed a simple physics-based model (see Supporting Information). This model takes in the geometry of a cluster and computes the different types of interactions based on fundamental physics equations. The model-predicted complexation energies against the known DFT-calculated complexation energies are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>, where red triangles ("ion-CO 2</p><p>-", e.g., K + -CO 2 -) represent systems that have only electrostatic ion-ion interactions (also see ΔH gas in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), green squares ("ion-solvent", e.g. NBu 4 + -2H 2 O) represent systems that have ion-dipole and dipole-dipole interactions, and purple circles ("ion-solvent-CO 2</p><p>-", e.g., Li + -CO 2 --3DME) represent systems that have ion-ion, ion-dipole, and   dipole-dipole interactions. The mean absolute error of the model-predicted complexation energy relative to the DFTcalculated value is about 0.12 eV per ion and solvent molecule in a cluster. For all the "ion-solvent-CO 2</p><p>-" clusters (purple circles), we calculate that on average 73% of the predicted complexation energy results from the electrostatic ion-ion interactions; likewise, the ion-dipole interaction is much stronger than the dipole-dipole interaction. This indicates that CO 2 activation could be achieved through electrolyte stabilization of the CO 2 -anion product due to a stronger interaction with CO 2 -than the neutral and nonpolar CO 2 gas. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">65</ref> Finally, we show the average CO 2 -bond angles in DME and water as a function of the number of solvent molecules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>) from our simulations. The average cation-to-CO 2 -distances are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>. Here, a small and computationally tractable number of solvent molecules could be used to simulate a reasonable solvation behavior, <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">67</ref> where key interactions between cation/anion and solvent (ion-dipole) are captured. We note that there is a different behavior for Li + -CO 2 --nDME where the CO 2 -angle keeps increasing as we increase the number of solvent molecules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). Specifically, for Li + -CO 2 --3DME, only one CO 2 -oxygen binds to Li + (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>), resulting in a weak interaction and thus increased angle and increased Li + -to-CO 2 -distance (by 0.9 Å, see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). Such a weakening interaction from bidentate to monodentate geometry is also captured by the physics model. For Li + -CO 2 --nH 2 O the increased angle and Li + -to-CO 2 -distance is rather minimal (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). These observations are important to keep in mind, as fully solvated systems indicate that the Li + -CO 2</p><p>-interaction is the weakest among alkali metal cations in DME but the strongest in water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). However, we know that hard shell Li + cation coordinates poorly to an adsorbed CO 2 on the surface, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and thus we also compare the relative stability of two configurations of Li + -CO 2 --4H 2 O (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>) as a function of the partial charge of CO 2 , assuming the dominant interaction comes from the electrostatic interaction. We find that for a partial charge of -1e, Li + preferably coordinates with CO 2</p><p>-, but only within about 0.16 eV compared to the other configuration according to DFT. As the charge of CO 2 is decreased to -0.6e, which mimics its charge state on the surface, we find that Li + now preferably coordinates with 4H 2 O according to our physics-based model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>■ CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have used ADMP simulations to investigate the interactions of the CO 2 -anion radical in various chemical environments, including both aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes. Simulations show the effect of cations and solvent molecules on the fundamental properties of bond distance and angle of CO 2 , e.g., DME solvation increases the interaction distance for small cations with CO 2 -, while for NX 4 + cations the difference is minimal. This correlates well with the complexation enthalpy of CO 2 -, offering a guide to which combinations of solvent and supporting electrolyte may provide the desired experimental conditions. Moreover, we have shown that the identity of the supporting electrolyte cation will likely matter more in polar solvents than in solvents of less polarity. Therefore, we can tailor the strength of interactions between CO 2 -and supporting electrolytes through the judicious choice of electrolyte cations and solvents. Our simulation and physics-based model provides a general and suitable approach to studying solvation effects particularly in an aprotic electrolyte environment, and it was shown that the electrochemical CO 2 RR activity could be correlated to the bulk solvation properties in DME and DMSO. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> We note the limitation of our model not yet including the electrode surface as well as the pH effect at the  interface, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">68</ref> and future experimental and computational efforts are necessary to elucidate the interactions of the CO 2 anion radical with the electrode surface.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.

Scheme (a) shows a molecular cluster with the dashed black line indicating the bond distance (measured Li + to CO 2 -from the center of the cation to the carbon atom) and gray lines showing how the bond angle (θ) is measured (with the carbon as the vertex of the angle). The lithium, carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms are shown in purple, dark gray, red, and light gray, respectively. (b) Computed trajectories of the bond distance (Δd) and CO 2 -angle (θ) over 500 fs for a Li + -CO 2 --3H 2 O molecular cluster. (c) Computed average Δd for various cationic complexes. All complexes in state (i) include three explicit solvent molecules. The dots indicate the difference in bond distances of optimized complexes with and without explicit solvent molecules. Me, Et, and Bu denote methyl, ethyl, and butyl groups, respectively.</figDesc><graphic coords="2,315.44,60.44,239.98,485.97" type="bitmap" /></figure>
