ABSTRACT: Successful transformation of carbon dioxide (CO2) into valueadded products is of great interest, as it contributes in part to the circular
carbon economy. Understanding chemical interactions that stabilize crucial
reaction intermediates of CO2 is important, and in this contribution, we
employ atom centered density matrix propagation (ADMP) molecular
dynamics simulations to investigate interactions between CO2− anion radicals
with surrounding solvent molecules and electrolyte cations in both aqueous
and nonaqueous environments. We show how diﬀerent cations and solvents
aﬀect the stability of the CO2− anion radical by examining its angle and
distance to a coordinating cation in molecular dynamics simulations. We
identify that the strength of CO2− interactions can be tailored through
choosing an appropriate cation and solvent combination. We anticipate that
this fundamental understanding of cation/solvent interactions can facilitate the optimization of a chemical pathway that results from
selective stabilization of a crucial reaction intermediate.

INTRODUCTION
Transforming CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels is of
great interest to create a sustainable carbon neutral cycle to
tackle challenges such as climate change.1−3 However,
reducing CO2 is a challenging process due to its thermodynamic stability, poor electron aﬃnity, and large kinetic
overpotentials. Additionally, as a nonpolar gas, it is only
sparingly soluble in water (0.033 M),4 a common solvent for
electrochemical reduction of CO2.1 Therefore, it might be
advantageous to use nonaqueous (aprotic) solvents due to the
higher CO2 solubility, enhanced potential window, as well as
lower proton concentrations that can suppress the undesired
hydrogen evolution reaction.5−7
The ﬁrst step of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR)
involves the formation of CO2−, and although successful
studies have been performed to unravel the mechanism of
electrochemical CO2RR,8−17 molecular-level understanding of
the dynamics of CO2− interacting with surrounding electrolyte
cations and solvents (aqueous vs nonaqueous) remains
unclear. Of particular interest is the cation eﬀect,18−24 which
was ﬁrst introduced by Murata and Hori, and it has been better
understood that coupling alkali metal cations (M+) with CO2−
cocatalyzes the ﬁrst step25,26 in aqueous solvents, i.e., * + CO2
+ M+ + e− → M+···*CO2− by a short-range electrostatic
interaction. In nonaqueous solvents, however, alkali metals are
known to inhibit CO2 reduction due to the formation of a
passivation layer containing carbonate species.27,28 Therefore,
electrolyte cations such as NX4+ (X = methyl, ethyl, and butyl

groups) are being used, and their catalytic roles were
examined.24,29 In aprotic Li−CO2 batteries, it was argued
that a LiCO2 intermediate is crucial to tuning CO2RR toward a
solution- versus surface-mediated pathway.30
In this contribution, we aim to provide theoretical insights
into the fundamental interactions between CO2−, obtained
from the electrochemical reduction of CO2 gas, and the
supporting electrolyte cations in various solvents, which will
help direct the mechanism toward desired products such as
CO, formic acid, and/or oxalate, and will lay a foundation to
the future study of speciﬁc catalyst systems. Here, we focus on
the stabilization eﬀect of the CO2− anion radical, as its
formation is likely to be the rate-determining step31 for CO2
reduction in some aqueous32−34 and nonaqueous15,35 media,
although this is still under debate.1 We compare water and
nonaqueous solvents (mainly dimethoxyethane (DME) in this
work), as glyme-ether-based solvents have been successfully
used for electrochemistry (e.g., metal-air/Mg battery) and gas
separation processes capturing CO236,37 but have been rarely
studied for CO2 reduction until recently,27 to the best of our
knowledge.

To gain understanding of the speciﬁc molecular-level
interactions, we used ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)
simulations.38,39 These AIMD simulations show the atomic
movement within the system, where the extremes and averages
of the oscillations can give detailed information on the stability
and other thermodynamic properties. We use the atom
centered density matrix propagation (ADMP)40−42 molecular
dynamics method, as it gives the accuracy of density functional
theory (DFT) and has advantages particularly around handling
the dynamics of charged and radical molecular systems.43−47
This approach allows us to gather accurate information on how
the CO2− anion radical interacts with cation and solvent
species, based on the computed descriptors such as
coordination bond distances (cation−CO2) and bond angles
to develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions.
The shorter coordination distance and/or more decreased
bond angle of CO2− indicate that the intermediate complex
can be present for prolonged periods and likely undergo
subsequent desired reactions such as chelation, charge transfer
interactions, and bond cleavage/formation reactions.48,49 We
further construct a physics-based model to rationalize the
relative contributions of electrostatic and covalent/noncovalent interactions to the stabilization eﬀects of CO2−.

COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
Initial geometry optimizations were performed using Gaussian
16 software50 at the ωb97xD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory51,52
with ultraﬁne integration grids and multiple conformers
considered.53 The frequencies were calculated at the same
level of theory. Upon geometry optimization, trajectories were
calculated using ADMP molecular dynamics at the ωb97xD/
jun-cc-pVDZ level of theory51,54,55 for 5000 time points (500
fs). ADMP simulations were performed with and without the
presence of implicit solvents56,57 (water (H2O), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (MeCN),
and n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF)). Optimized, maximum,
mean, and variation amplitude of the CO2− angle (θ) and the
CO2− distance (to the cation, d) were extracted from the
AIMD trajectory. As shown in Figure 1a, the CO2− angle (θ) is
measured from one oxygen to the other, with the carbon atom
as the angle vertex. The CO2−-to-cation distance (d) is
measured from the carbon of the CO2− to the center of the
cation (either the cation atom or the nitrogen in the
ammonium cations). A typical ADMP trajectory is shown in
Figure 1b, where CO2− oscillates around its equilibrium
position over the course of the simulation. Additional details of
the simulations are provided in the Supporting Information
(SI).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The interaction strength of two charged particles is inversely
related to the separating distance.58 As shown in yellow bars in
Figure 1c, based on the simulations, we observe that the
interaction of dynamic water molecules increases the cation-toCO2− distance (Δd) for all cations compared to the gas-phase
geometry, which manifests less negative complexation energies
and binding energies compared to those in the gas phase
(ΔHgas, Table 1). Note that the equations for the complexation
enthalpy calculations are provided in the Supporting
Information. In the case of the DME solvent system, the
chelation of the DME molecule with the alkali metal cation
increases the interaction distance for alkali metal cations with

the CO2−, while for NX4+ cations (X = Me, Et, and Bu), the
diﬀerence is minimal (<0.1 Å). This is largely due to the
chemical diﬀerences between water and DME molecules.
Water molecules are strongly polar and have strong ion-dipole

each simulation three times with diﬀerent initial geometries
(randomly generated and subsequently optimized) to make
sure that the selection of initial structures have no role in
dictating the ﬁnal results. The average and maximum cation-toCO2− distances are shown in Figure 3.
We observe that the strength of interaction between NBu4+
and CO2− decreases with increasing solvent polarity, indicated
by the increasing cation-to-CO2− distance, as shown in Figure
3. Such an observation is consistent with the dominant
electrostatic interactions and has experimental implications on
salt dissociation or formation of ion pairs.25,27 The positive
charge on the NBu4+ cation is highly shielded by the bulky and
electron donating alkyl chains, which means that changing
solvents has a relatively minimal eﬀect on the NBu4+. However,
the strength of the interaction between CO2− and NBu4+ is
aﬀected by how strongly CO2− is coordinated to the solvent
and cationic species. Thus, increasing the polarity of the
solvent increases CO2− coordination with the solvent,
weakening the bond between CO2− and NBu4+. Similar
qualitative trends in CO2RR were also reported by Berto et
al.59 and Shi et al.,60 where voltammetric experiments in the
presence of NBu4+ electrolytes have shown larger current
density values for CO2RR in highly polar DMF and MeCN, as
compared to low polarity THF. Here, DMSO has the largest
standard deviation (Figure 3), which was also found to exhibit
the largest deviation from trends due to coordination via the
sulfur atom (as opposed to via the oxygen atom in water and
THF) in a study of aprotic solvent (THF, DMF, and DMSO)
adsorption on metal surfaces by Nørskov and co-workers.61 In
aprotic solvents and NBu4+ salts, tailoring the lifetime of the
CO2− will likely depend on solvent, due to the stabilizing
inﬂuence of more polar solvents.
The foregoing analysis suggests that both solvents and
cations play an important role in the stabilization of the CO2−
radical,59,60 but the precise eﬀects are less clear. On the basis of
our simulations, we hypothesize that inner-sphere solvation
eﬀects are the result of electrostatic and covalent/noncovalent
interactions based around solvent stabilization and cation
binding, and to this end, we sought to rationalize these by
constructing a simple physics-based model. Compared to gasphase CO2−, the introduction of a solvent molecule or a cation
reduces the angle of CO2−. In Figure 4a, the largest reductions
are observed with cations without solvent molecules, following
the trend of Li+ > Na+ > K+ > NX4+ in the gas phase (gray
bars), where X = methyl or longer alkyl groups. There is an
overall trend of a larger change in the bond angle (Δθ) being

interactions with cations and CO2−, as seen from the
computed complexation enthalpies (ΔHcomplex) summarized
in Table 1. DME is weakly polar and has chelating interactions
with alkali metal cations, where the unshielded positive charge
can interact closely with the lone pairs on the oxygen atoms of
DME. On the basis of the computed enthalpies of complexation (Table 1), the CO2− species itself weakly interacts with
DME as compared to water (by 0.50 eV) because DME
molecules do not have any strong localized partial positive
charges. The NBu4+ positive charge is highly shielded by the
butyl arms and as such does not closely interact with the DME
oxygen atoms, which also can be seen from our quantum
chemical calculations that the diﬀerence between ΔHcomplex
and ΔHgas for the NBu4+ complex is much smaller than that for
alkali metal cations (Table 1). The optimized structures of
NBu4+ complexes are shown in Figure S1. The optimized
structures of Li+−CO2−−solvent with DME and H2O also
corroborate the above analysis; i.e., the oxygen atoms of CO2−
only bind to Li+ in the DME solvent, as shown in Figure 2a,
whereas in water one of the CO2− oxygen atoms binds to Li+,
and the other interacts with water to form an O···H hydrogen
bond as shown in Figure 2b. Overall, this suggests that the
identity of the supporting electrolyte cation, as well as the
polarity of solvents, both dictate the strength of interactions of
the CO2− anion radical, which primarily consist of (electrostatic) ion-ion and ion-dipole interactions and hydrogen
bonds. The diﬀerent types of interactions will be discussed
in more detail.
To further explore how the NX4+−CO2− interaction
responds to the polarity of the solvent, we carried out
ADMP simulations with three explicit solvent molecules (in
THF, MeCN, DMSO, DMF, and water) and at the same time
included the implicit solvent ﬁeld of corresponding solvent
models in Gaussian 16. For these bulky clusters, we repeated

complex stability is associated with a decreased CO2− angle.
This decreased angle is due to anion radical stabilization
through ion-ion interactions, ion-dipole interactions, and/or
hydrogen bonds. Given the computed trends of solvent
polarity and complexation enthalpy simultaneously (Figure 3
and Figure 4b) and together with known experiment data, we
would be able to provide guidance on the electrolyte
environments, e.g., with larger stabilizing eﬀects on CO2−63
toward the desired binding.
To decompose the quantum chemistry-calculated complexation enthalpies into stabilization eﬀects by electrostatic ionion interactions and/or ion-dipole interactions explicitly, we
have constructed a simple physics-based model (see Supporting Information). This model takes in the geometry of a cluster
and computes the diﬀerent types of interactions based on
fundamental physics equations. The model-predicted complexation energies against the known DFT-calculated complexation
energies are shown in Figure 5, where red triangles (“ion-

increased angle and Li+-to-CO2− distance is rather minimal
(Table 2 and Figure 6b). These observations are important to
keep in mind, as fully solvated systems indicate that the Li+−
CO2− interaction is the weakest among alkali metal cations in
DME but the strongest in water (Figure S4). However, we
know that hard shell Li+ cation coordinates poorly to an
adsorbed CO2 on the surface,26 and thus we also compare the
relative stability of two conﬁgurations of Li+−CO2−−4H2O
(Figure S6) as a function of the partial charge of CO2,
assuming the dominant interaction comes from the electrostatic interaction. We ﬁnd that for a partial charge of −1e, Li+
preferably coordinates with CO2−, but only within about 0.16
eV compared to the other conﬁguration according to DFT. As
the charge of CO2 is decreased to −0.6e, which mimics its
charge state on the surface, we ﬁnd that Li+ now preferably
coordinates with 4H2O according to our physics-based model
(Figure S6).

dipole-dipole interactions. The mean absolute error of the
model-predicted complexation energy relative to the DFTcalculated value is about 0.12 eV per ion and solvent molecule
in a cluster. For all the “ion-solvent-CO2−” clusters (purple
circles), we calculate that on average 73% of the predicted
complexation energy results from the electrostatic ion-ion
interactions; likewise, the ion-dipole interaction is much
stronger than the dipole-dipole interaction. This indicates
that CO2 activation could be achieved through electrolyte
stabilization of the CO2− anion product due to a stronger
interaction with CO2− than the neutral and nonpolar CO2
gas.64,65
Finally, we show the average CO2− bond angles in DME and
water as a function of the number of solvent molecules (Figure
6) from our simulations. The average cation-to-CO2− distances
are shown in Figure S2. Here, a small and computationally
tractable number of solvent molecules could be used to
simulate a reasonable solvation behavior,66,67 where key
interactions between cation/anion and solvent (ion-dipole)
are captured. We note that there is a diﬀerent behavior for
Li+−CO2−−nDME where the CO2− angle keeps increasing as
we increase the number of solvent molecules (Figure 6a).
Speciﬁcally, for Li+−CO2−−3DME, only one CO2− oxygen
binds to Li+ (Figure 2a), resulting in a weak interaction and
thus increased angle and increased Li+-to-CO2− distance (by
0.9 Å, see Table 2 and Figure 1c). Such a weakening
interaction from bidentate to monodentate geometry is also
captured by the physics model. For Li+−CO2−−nH2O the

CONCLUSIONS
We have used ADMP simulations to investigate the
interactions of the CO2− anion radical in various chemical
environments, including both aqueous and nonaqueous
electrolytes. Simulations show the eﬀect of cations and solvent
molecules on the fundamental properties of bond distance and
angle of CO2, e.g., DME solvation increases the interaction
distance for small cations with CO2−, while for NX4+ cations
the diﬀerence is minimal. This correlates well with the
complexation enthalpy of CO2−, oﬀering a guide to which
combinations of solvent and supporting electrolyte may
provide the desired experimental conditions. Moreover, we
have shown that the identity of the supporting electrolyte
cation will likely matter more in polar solvents than in solvents
of less polarity. Therefore, we can tailor the strength of
interactions between CO2− and supporting electrolytes
through the judicious choice of electrolyte cations and
solvents. Our simulation and physics-based model provides a
general and suitable approach to studying solvation eﬀects
particularly in an aprotic electrolyte environment, and it was
shown that the electrochemical CO2RR activity could be
correlated to the bulk solvation properties in DME and
DMSO.27 We note the limitation of our model not yet
including the electrode surface as well as the pH eﬀect at the
